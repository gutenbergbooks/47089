<h2 id="preface1" title="Editor’s Preface"><a class="noform"
href="#contents">EDITOR’S PREFACE</a></h2>

<p class="first">In issuing these volumes of a series of Handbooks
on the Artistic Crafts, it will be well to state what
are our general aims.</p>

<p>In the first place, we wish to provide trustworthy
text-books of workshop practice, from the points of
view of experts who have critically examined the
methods current in the shops, and putting aside
vain survivals, are prepared to say what is good
workmanship, and to set up a standard of quality
in the crafts which are more especially associated
with design. Secondly, in doing this, we hope to
treat design itself as an essential part of good workmanship.
During the last century most of the arts,
save painting and sculpture of an academic kind,
were little considered, and there was a tendency to
look on “design” as a mere matter of <em class="italic">appearance</em>.
Such “ornamentation” as there was was usually
obtained by following in a mechanical way a drawing
provided by an artist who often knew little
of the technical processes involved in production.
With the critical attention given to the crafts by
<span class="xxpn" id="pviii"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-viii]</a></span>
Ruskin and Morris, it came to be seen that it was
impossible to detach design from craft in this way,
and that, in the widest sense, true design is an
inseparable element of good quality, involving as it
does the selection of good and suitable material,
contrivance for special purpose, expert workmanship,
proper finish, and so on, far more than mere
ornament, and indeed, that ornamentation itself was
rather an exuberance of fine workmanship than a
matter of merely abstract lines. Workmanship
when separated by too wide a gulf from fresh
thought—that is, from design—inevitably decays,
and, on the other hand, ornamentation, divorced
from workmanship, is necessarily unreal, and quickly
falls into affectation. Proper ornamentation may be
defined as a language addressed to the eye; it is
pleasant thought expressed in the speech of the tool.</p>

<p>In the third place, we would have this series put
artistic craftsmanship before people as furnishing
reasonable occupations for those who would gain a
livelihood. Although within the bounds of academic
art, the competition, of its kind, is so acute that
only a very few per cent. can fairly hope to succeed
as painters and sculptors; yet, as artistic
craftsmen, there is every probability that nearly
every one who would pass through a sufficient
period of apprenticeship to workmanship and design
would reach a measure of success.</p>

<p>In the blending of handwork and thought in
<span class="xxpn" id="pix"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-ix]</a></span>
such arts as we propose to deal with, happy careers
may be found as far removed from the dreary
routine of hack labour as from the terrible uncertainty
of academic art. It is desirable in every way
that men of good education should be brought back
into the productive crafts: there are more than
enough of us “in the city,” and it is probable that
more consideration will be given in this century
than in the last to Design and Workmanship.</p>

<div class="tb">·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;·&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;·</div>

<p>Of all the Arts, writing, perhaps, shows most
clearly the formative force of the instruments
used. In the analysis which Mr. Johnston gives us
in this volume, nearly all seems to be explained by
the two factors, utility and masterly use of tools.
No one has ever invented a form of script, and
herein lies the wonderful interest of the subject;
the forms used have always formed themselves by
a continuous process of development.</p>

<p>The curious assemblages of wedge-shaped indentations
which make up Assyrian writing are a
direct outcome of the clay cake, and the stylus
used to imprint little marks on it. The forms of
Chinese characters, it is evident, were made by
quickly representing with a brush earlier pictorial
signs. The Roman characters, which are our
letters to-day, although their earlier forms have
only come down to us cut in stone, must have
been formed by incessant practice with a flat, stiff
<span class="xxpn" id="px"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-x]</a></span>
brush, or some such tool. The disposition of the
thicks and thins, and the exact shape of the curves,
must have been settled by an instrument used
rapidly; I suppose, indeed, that most of the great
monumental inscriptions were designed <em class="italic">in situ</em> by
a master writer, and only cut in by the mason,
the cutting being merely a fixing, as it were,
of the writing, and the cut inscriptions must
always have been intended to be completed by
painting.</p>

<div>
<img src="images/i010b.jpg" width="600" height="339" class="textexcerpt"
alt="The “Rustic letters” found in stone inscriptions of the fourth
century are still more obviously cursive, and in the Catacombs
some painted inscriptions of this kind remain which perfectly
show that they were rapidly written. The
ordinary “lower case” type with which this page is printed is, in
its turn, a simplified cursive form of the Capital letters. The
Italic is a still more swiftly written hand, and comes near to
the standard for ordinary handwriting." />
</div>

<p>All fine monumental inscriptions and types
are but forms of writing modified according to
the materials to which they are applied. The
Italian type-founders of the fifteenth century
sought out fine examples of old writing as models,
and for their capitals studied the monumental
Roman inscriptions. Roman letters were first
introduced into English inscriptions by Italian
artists. Torrigiano, on the tombs he made for
<span class="xxpn" id="pxi"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xi]</a></span>
Henry VII. in Westminster Abbey and for Dr.
Young at the Rolls Chapel, designed probably
the most beautiful inscriptions of this kind to be
found in England.</p>

<p>This volume is remarkable for the way in which
its subject seems to be developed inevitably.
There is here no collection of all sorts of lettering,
some sensible and many eccentric, for us to
choose from, but we are shown the essentials of
form and spacing, and the way is opened out to
all who will devote practice to it to form an
individual style by imperceptible variations from
a fine standard.</p>

<p>Writing is for us the most universal of the Arts,
and most craftsmen have to deal with lettering of
a more formal kind. It is a commonplace of historical
criticism to point out how much the Italian
artists owed to the general practice amongst them
of goldsmith’s work, a craft which required accuracy
and delicacy of hand. We cannot go back to that,
but we do need a basis of training in a demonstrably
useful art, and I doubt if any is so generally
fitted for the purpose of educating the hand, the
eye, and the mind as this one of

<p>“<em class="italic">We must set up the strong present tense against all the
rumours of wrath, past or to come. So many things are
unsettled which it is of the first importance to settle,—and,
pending their settlement, we will do as we do.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Expediency
of literature, reason of literature, lawfulness of writing
down a thought, is questioned; much is to say on both sides, and,
while the fight waxes hot, thou, dearest scholar, stick to thy
foolish task, add a line every hour, and between whiles add a
line. Right to hold land, right of property is disputed, and
the conventions convene, and before the vote is taken, dig away
in your garden, and spend your earnings as a waif or godsend
to all serene and beautiful purposes. Life itself is a
bubble and a scepticism, and a sleep within a sleep. Grant
it, and as much more as they will,—but thou, God’s darling!
heed thy private dream: thou wilt not be missed in the
scorning and scepticism: there are enough of them: stay
there in thy closet, and toil, until the rest are agreed what
to do about it. Thy sickness, they say, and thy puny habit,
require that thou do this or avoid that, but know that thy
life is a flitting state, a tent for a night, and do thou, sick or
well, finish that stint. Thou art sick, but shall not be
worse, and the universe, which holds thee dear, shall be the
better.</em>”</p>

<h3 class="preface">WRITING</h3>

<p class="first">The arts of WRITING, ILLUMINATING,
&#38; LETTERING offer a wide field for the
ingenious and careful craftsman and open the
way to a number of delightful occupations. Beyond
their many uses—some of which are referred
to below—they have a very great educational value.
This has long been recognized in the teaching of
elementary design, and the practice of designing
Alphabets and Inscriptions is now common in
most Schools of Art. Much would be gained
by substituting, generally, <span class="smcapitals">WRITING</span> for <em class="italic">designing</em>,
because <em class="italic">writing</em> being the medium by which
nearly all our letters have been evolved from the
Roman Capital (see p.
<a href="#p035">35</a>), the use of the pen—essentially
a letter-making tool—gives a practical
insight into the construction of letters attainable
in no other way. The most important use of
letters is in the making of books, and the foundations
of typography and book decoration may be
mastered—<em class="italic">as they were laid</em>—by the planning,
writing, and illuminating of MSS. in book form.
Of this a modern printer (see also p.
<a href="#p368">368</a>) says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the making of the Written Book,&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. the
adjustment of letter to letter, of word to word, of picture
to text and of text to picture, and of the whole to the
subject matter and to the page, admits of great nicety and
perfection. The type is fluid, and the letters and words,
picture, text, and page are conceived of as one and are all
executed by one hand, or by several hands all working
together without intermediation on one identical page and
<span class="xxpn" id="pxiv"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xiv]</a></span>
with a view to one identical effect. In the Printed Book
this adjustment is more difficult.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Yet in the
making of the printed book, as in the making of the
written book, this adjustment is essential, and should
be specially borne in mind, and Calligraphy and immediate
decoration by hand and the unity which should
be inseparably associated therewith would serve as an
admirable discipline to that end.”</p></div>

<p>And though calligraphy is a means to many ends,
a fine MS. has a beauty of its own that—if two
arts may be compared—surpasses that of the finest
printing. This in itself would justify the transcribing
and preservation of much good literature in this
beautiful form (besides the preparation of “Illuminated
Addresses,” Service Books, Heraldic and other
MSS.) and make the practice of formal writing
desirable. And furthermore as the old-fashioned
notion <em class="italic">that a legible hand is a mark of bad breeding</em> dies
out, it may be that our current handwriting will
take legibility and beauty from such practice. And
even the strict utilitarian could not fail to value the
benefits that might some day come to men, if children
learnt to appreciate beauty of form in their letters
and in their writing the beauty of carefulness.</p>

<h3 class="preface">ILLUMINATING</h3>

<p>Of the practice of <span class="smcapitals">ILLUMINATING</span>—properly
associated with writing—it may be observed
that, among various ways of acquiring <em class="italic">a knowledge
of the elements of design &#38; decoration</em> it is one of the
most simple and complete. Moreover, a fine
illumination or miniature has a beauty of its own
that may surpass the finest printed book-decoration.
And pictures in books may be as desirable as pictures
on the wall—even though like the beautiful
household gods of the Japanese they are kept in safe
hiding and displayed only now and then.
<span class="xxpn" id="pxv"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xv]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="preface">LETTERING</h3>

<p>Magnificent as are the dreams of a fine Decoration
based on lettering, the innumerable practical
applications of <span class="smcapitals">LETTERING</span> itself (see Chap. XVI.)
make the study of <em class="italic">Letter-Craft</em> not only desirable
but imperative. And perhaps I may here be permitted
to quote from <em class="italic">The Athenæum</em> of Feb. 3,
1906, which says of “the new school of scribes
and designers of inscriptions”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“These have attacked the problem of applied design
in one of its simplest and most universal applications,
and they have already done a great deal to establish a
standard by which we shall be bound to revise all printed
and written lettering. If once the principles they have
established could gain currency, what a load of ugliness
would be lifted from modern civilization! If once the
names of streets and houses, and, let us hope, even the
announcements of advertisers, were executed in beautifully
designed and well-spaced letters, the eye would become
so accustomed to good proportion in these simple and
obvious things that it would insist on a similar gratification
in more complex and difficult matters.”</p></div>

<p>Yet <em class="italic">Ordinary Writing</em> and even scribbling has
had, and still might have, a good influence on the
art of the Letter maker, and at least the common
use of pen, ink, &#38; paper makes it a simple matter
for any one to essay a formal or ‘book’ hand.
A broad nib cut to give clean thick and thin
strokes (without appreciable variation of pressure)
will teach any one who cares to learn, very clearly
and certainly. And though much practice goes to
the making of a perfect MS., it is easier than people
suppose to make really beautiful things by taking a
little pains. As “copy book” hands simple, primitive
pen-forms—such as the Uncial &#38; Half-Uncial
(pp. <a href="#p038">38</a>,
<a href="#p070">70</a>)—afford the best training and permit
<span class="xxpn" id="pxvi"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xvi]</a></span>
the cultivation of the freedom which is essential
in writing: they prepare the way for the mastery
of the most practical characters—the ROMAN
CAPITAL, roman small-letter, &#38; <em class="italic">Italic</em>—and
the ultimate development of a lively and personal
penmanship.</p>

<h3 class="preface">MODERN DEVELOPMENT OF WRITING &#38;
ILLUMINATING</h3>

<p>Developing, or rather <em class="italic">re</em>-developing, an art involves
<em class="italic">the tracing in one’s own experience of a process
resembling its past development</em>. And it is by such
a course that we, who wish to revive Writing
&#38; Illuminating, may <em class="italic">renew</em> them, evolving new
methods and traditions for ourselves, till at length
we attain a modern and beautiful technique. And
if we would be more than amateurs, we must
study and practise <em class="italic">the making of beautiful <span class="smcapitals">THINGS</span></em>
and thereby gain experience of Tools, Materials,
and Methods. For it is certain that we must
teach ourselves how to make beautiful things,
and must have some notion of the aim and bent
of our work, <em class="italic">of what we seek and what we do</em>.</p>

<p>Early illuminated MSS. and printed books with
woodcuts (or good facsimiles) may be studied with
advantage by the would-be Illuminator, and he
should if possible learn to draw from hedgerows
and from country gardens. In his practice he
should begin as a scribe making MS. books and
then decorating them with simple pen &#38; colour
work. We may pass most naturally from writing
to the decoration of writing, by the making and
placing of <em class="italic">initial letters</em>. For in seeking first a fine
<em class="italic">effectiveness</em> we may put readableness before “looks”
and, generally, make a text to read smoothly, broken
only by its natural division into paragraphs, chapters,
and the like. But these divisions, suggesting
that a pause in reading is desirable, suggest also that
<span class="xxpn" id="pxvii"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xvii]</a></span>
a mark is required—as in music—indicating the
“rest”: this a large capital does most effectively.</p>

<p>A technical division of illumination into <em class="italic">Colour-work</em>,
<em class="italic">Pen-work</em>, and <em class="italic">Draughtsmanship</em> is convenient
(see Chap. XI.). Though these are
properly combined in practice, it is suggested
that, at first, it will be helpful to think of their
effects as distinct so that we may attain quite
definitely some mastery of pure, bright, colours
&#38; simple colour effects, of pen flourishing and
ornament, and of drawing—whether plain or
coloured, that will go decoratively with writing
or printing. This distinction makes it easier to
devise definite schemes of illumination that will
be within our power to carry out at any stage
of our development. And while the penman
inevitably gains some power of pen decoration it
is well for him as an illuminator to practise in
bright colours and gold; for illumination may be
as brilliant and splendid in its own way as stained
glass, enamels, and jewellery are in
theirs.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> At
first, at any rate, hues that have the least suspicion
of being dull or weak are to be avoided as though
they were plainly “muddy” or “washed-out.”
The more definite we make our work the more
definitely will our materials instruct us; and such
service must precede mastery.</p>

<h3 class="preface">MODERN DEVELOPMENT OF LETTERING</h3>

<p>Referring again to good <span class="smcapitals">LETTERING</span>: the
second part of this book deals with some of its
<em class="italic">Qualities</em>,
<em class="italic">Forms</em>—the Roman Capitals &#38; their important
pen-derivatives—and <em class="italic">Uses</em>. It is written
<span class="xxpn" id="pxviii"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xviii]</a></span>
largely from the penman’s point of
view,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> but a
chapter on inscriptions in stone has been added and
various types and modes of letter making are discussed.
The essential qualities of Lettering are
<em class="italic">legibility, beauty, and character</em>, and these are to be
found in numberless inscriptions and writings of
the last two thousand years. But since the traditions
of the early scribes and printers and carvers
have decayed, we have become so used to inferior
forms and arrangements that we hardly realize
how poor the bulk of modern lettering really is.
In the recent “revival” of printing and book
decoration, many attempts have been made to
design fine alphabets and beautiful books—in a
number of cases with notable success. But the
study of Palæography and Typography has hitherto
been confined to a few specialists, and these attempts
to make “” books often shew a
vagueness of intention, which weakens their interest
and an ignorance of <em class="italic">Letter-craft</em> which makes
the poorest, ordinary printing seem pleasant by
comparison. The development of Letters was a
purely natural process in the course of which distinct
and characteristic types were evolved and
some knowledge of how these came into being will
help us in understanding their anatomy and distinguishing
good and bad forms. A comparatively
little study of old manuscripts and inscriptions will
make clear much of the beauty and method of the
early work. And we may accustom ourselves to
good lettering by carefully studying such examples
as we can find, and acquire a practical knowledge
<span class="xxpn" id="pxix"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xix]</a></span>
of it by copying from them with a pen or chisel or
other letter-making tool. A conscientious endeavour
to make our lettering readable, and
models<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
and methods chosen to that end, will keep our
work straight: and after all the problem before us
is fairly simple—<em class="italic">To make good letters and to arrange
them well.</em> To make good letters is not necessarily
to “design” them—they have been designed long
ago—but it is to take the best letters we can find,
and to acquire them <em class="italic">and make them our own</em>. To
arrange letters well requires no great art, but it
requires a practical knowledge of letter-forms and
of the rational methods of grouping these forms to
suit every circumstance.</p>

<h3 class="preface">THE SCOPE OF THIS HANDBOOK</h3>

<p>Generally this book has been planned as a sort of
“guide” to models and methods for Letter-craftsmen
and Students—more particularly for those who
cannot see the actual processes of Writing, Illuminating,
&#38;c. carried out, and who may not have
access to collections of MSS. Much of, if not all,
the explanation is of the most obvious, but that,
I hope, gives it more nearly the value of a practical
demonstration. In describing methods and processes
I have generally used the present tense—saying
that they “<em class="italic">are</em>—”: this is to be taken as
meaning that they <em class="italic">are</em> so in early MSS. and inscriptions,
and in the practice of the modern school
of scribes who found their work on them.</p>

<p>Regarding the copying of early work (see pp.
<a href="#p195">195</a>, <a href="#p323">323</a>,
&#38;c.) it is contended that to revive an art
<span class="xxpn" id="pxx"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xx]</a></span>
one must begin at the beginning, and that, in an
honest attempt to achieve a simple end, one may
lawfully follow a
method<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> without imitating a style.
We have an excellent precedent in the Italian
scribes who went back 300 years for a model and
gave us the Roman small-letter as a result (see p.
<a href="#p047">47</a>). The beginners attitude is largely, and necessarily,
imitative, and at this time we should have
much to hope from a school of Artist-Beginners
who would make good construction the only
novelty in their work. We have almost as much—or
as <em class="italic">little</em>—to be afraid of in Originality as in
imitation, and our best attitude towards this problem
is that of the Irishman with a difficulty—“to
look it boldly in the face and pass on”—<em class="italic">making an
honest attempt to achieve a simple end</em>. Perhaps we
trouble too much about what we “ought to do” &#38;
“do”: it is of greater moment <em class="italic">to know what we
are doing &#38; trying to do</em>. In so far as tradition fails
to bound or guide us we must think for ourselves
and in practice make methods and rules for ourselves:
endeavouring that our work should <em class="italic">be effective</em>
rather than have “a fine effect”—or <em class="italic">be</em>, rather
than appear, good—and following our craft rather
than making it follow us. For all things—materials,
tools, methods—are waiting to serve us and
<span class="xxpn" id="pxxi"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xxi]</a></span>
we have only to find the “spell” that will set the
whole universe a-making for us.</p>

<p>Endeavouring to attain this freedom we may
make Rules and Methods serve us (see p.
<a href="#p221">221</a>),
knowing that Rules are only <em class="italic">Guides</em> and that
Methods are suggested by the work itself: from
first to last our necessary equipment consists in
good models, good tools, &#38; a good will. Within
the limits of our craft we cannot have too much
freedom; for too much fitting &#38; planning makes
the work lifeless, and it is conceivable that in the
finest work the Rules are concealed, and that, for
example, a MS. might be most beautiful without
ruled lines and methodical arrangement (see p.
<a href="#p343">343</a>). But the more clearly we realize our limitations
the more practical our work. And it is
rather as a stimulus to definite thought—not as an
embodiment of hard and fast rules—that various
methodical plans &#38; tables of comparison &#38; analysis
are given in this book. It is well to recognize at
once, the fact that mere taking to pieces, or analysing,
followed by “putting together,” is only a
means of becoming acquainted with the mechanism
of construction, and will not reproduce the
original beauty of a thing: it is an education for
work, but all work which is honest and straightforward
has a beauty and freshness of its own.</p>

<p>The commercial prospects of the student of
Writing &#38; Illuminating—or, indeed, of any Art
or Craft—are somewhat problematical, depending
largely on his efficiency &#38; opportunities. There is a
fairly steady demand for Illuminated Addresses; but
the independent craftsman would have to establish
himself by <em class="italic">useful</em> practice, and by seizing opportunities,
and by doing his work well. Only an attempt
<span class="xxpn" id="pxxii"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p-xxii]</a></span>
to do practical work will raise practical problems,
and therefore <em class="italic">useful practice is the making of real or
definite things</em>. In the special conditions attaching
to work which the craftsman is commissioned to
do for another person, there is a great advantage.
And the beginner by setting himself specific tasks
(for example: making a MS. book for a specific purpose—see
p.
<a href="#p100">100</a>) should give reality to his work.
As a craftsman in Lettering he might get work in
some of the directions mentioned in pp. <a href="#appendix-a">337</a>–<a
href="#p341">341</a>.</p>

<p>Although the demand for good work is at present
limited, the production of good work will inevitably
create a demand; and, finally, the value of
Quality is always recognized—sooner or later, but
inevitably—and whatever “practical” reasons we
may hear urged in favour of <em class="italic">Quantity</em>, the value of
Quality is gaining recognition every day in commerce
and even in art, and there or here, sooner
or later we shall know that <em class="italic">we can afford the best</em>.</p>

in figs. <a href="#fig87">87</a>, <a href="#fig126">126</a>, make effective

and illustrated in the line-finishings (fig.

to <em class="italic">branching out</em> and is re-creative,
whereas the prolonged line is tiresome
(see figs. <em class="italic"><a href="#fig-a-n">k</a></em>,

Generally <em class="italic">round-shouldered</em> letters have
finer and more stable forms than square-shouldered,
and generally emphasis
should be laid on the <em class="italic">strong, thick stroke
running obliquely down from left to right</em>
(<img class="letter5" src="images/i026c1.jpg" width="90"

while the weak, thin stroke
(<img class="letter5" src="images/i026c2.jpg" width="90"
height="90" alt="thin oblique up from left to right" />)
is rather to be avoided (see
fig. <em class="italic"><a href="#fig-a-n">m</a></em>). The
writing used in the diagrams in this
book, considered as a formal hand,
shews a little too much of the thin
stroke (see p.

<p class="hang3"><span class="nowrap">P. <a href="#p324">324</a>.</span>
Commonly letters are made more slender in
proportion as they are made larger, and
it is generally not desirable (or possible)
in practical work to have exactly similar
proportions in large and small lettering.</p>

A small writing is often the most practical—in
the matter of speed in reading and
less bulk in the MS., besides speed in
the writing of it—but it is more difficult
for the beginner to write it well and it
is apt to lose some of the virtues of
formal penmanship (see Fine-pen writing

<span class="smaller">THE DEVELOPMENT OF WRITING</span></a></h3>

<p class="first">Nearly every type of letter with which we are
familiar is derived from the Roman Capitals, and has
come to us through the medium, or been modified
by the influence, of the pen. And, therefore,
in trying to revive good Lettering, we cannot
do better than make a practical study of the
best pen-forms, and learn at the same time to
appreciate the forms of their magnificent archetypes
as preserved in the monumental Roman
inscriptions.</p>

<p>The development and the relations of the principal
types of letters are briefly set out in the
accompanying “family tree”—fig. <a href="#fig01">1</a>. When the
student has learnt to cut and handle a pen, he
can trace this development practically by trying
to copy a few words from each example given
below. <span class="xxpn" id="p036"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p036]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">THE ROMAN ALPHABET.</em>—The Alphabet,
as we know it, begins with the ROMAN
CAPITALS<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
(see fig.
<a href="#fig02">2</a>). Their fine monumental
forms were evolved by the use of the chisel—probably
under the influence of writing—and had
reached full development about 2000 years ago (see
Plates <a class="noform" href="#plate01">I.</a>, <a class="noform" href="#plate02">II.</a>,
and Chapter XV.).</p>

</div>

<p><em class="italic">FORMAL WRITING</em>—the “<em class="italic">book-hand</em>” or
professional writing of the scribes—comes of the
careful writing of the Roman Capitals (see also
<em class="italic">footnote</em>, p. <a href="#p038">38</a>, on the beginnings of fine penmanship).
It was <span class="nowrap">the—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em class="italic">literary hand</em>, used in the production of exactly
written MSS., and therefore a hand of comparatively
limited use. By its side, and of course of far more
extensive and general use, was the <em class="italic">cursive hand</em> of the
time”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p037"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p037]</a></span></p></div>

<p>In early <em class="italic">cursive writing</em>—the running-hand or
ordinary writing of the <span class="nowrap">people—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Letters are nothing more than the old Roman
letters written with speed, and thus undergoing certain
modifications in their forms, which eventually developed
into the <em class="italic">minuscule
hand</em>.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>

</div>

<p>Here it is sufficient to trace the history of the
<em class="italic">formal</em> Latin “hands,” but the continual, modifying
influence exerted on them by the ordinary <em class="italic">cursive</em>
writing should be borne in mind. Notable results
of this influence are seen in <em class="italic">Half-Uncials</em> and <em class="italic">Italics</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">SQUARE CAPITALS</em> were formal, pen-made
Roman Capitals, of the monumental type: they
were used (perhaps from the <em class="italic">second</em>) till about the
<span class="xxpn" id="p038"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p038]</a></span>
end of the <em class="italic">fifth</em> century for important books (see
<a href="#plate03">Plate III.</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">RUSTIC CAPITALS</em> were probably a variety
of the “Square Capitals,” and were in use till about
the end of the <em class="italic">fifth</em> century (fig.
<a href="#fig04">4</a>; see also p.
<a href="#p297">297</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">ROMAN UNCIALS</em> were fully developed by
the fourth century, and were used from the fifth

</div>

<p>Uncials are true
pen-forms<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>—more quickly
written than the “Square,” and clearer than the
“Rustic” Capitals—having the characteristic,
simple strokes and beautiful, rounded shapes which
flow from the rightly handled reed or quill. The
<span class="xxpn" id="p040"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p040]</a></span>
typical Uncial letters are the round D, E, H, M, U
(or V), and A and Q (see p.
<a href="#p300">300</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">ROMAN HALF-UNCIALS</em>—or <em

were mixed <em class="italic">Uncial</em> and <em class="italic">Cursive</em> forms

<p><em class="italic">IRISH HALF-UNCIALS</em> were founded on
the Roman Half-Uncials (probably brought to Ireland
by Roman missionaries in the sixth century).
As a beautiful writing, they attained in the seventh
century a degree of perfection since unrivalled (see
<a href="#plate06">Plate VI.</a>).</p>

<p>They developed in the eighth and ninth centuries

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The period of Charlemagne is an epoch in the history
of the handwritings of Western Europe. With the revival
of learning naturally came a reform of the writing in which
the works of literature were to be made known. A decree
of the year 789 called for the revision of church books;
and this work naturally brought with it a great activity in
the writing schools of the chief monastic centres of France.
And in none was there greater activity than at Tours,
where, under the rule of Alcuin of York, who was abbot
of St. Martin’s from 796 to 804, was specially developed
the exact hand which has received the name of the
Caroline
Minuscule.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>

<div class="xxpn" id="p043"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p043]</a></div>

<p>The influence of the Caroline hands (see fig.
<a href="#fig08">8</a>)
presently spread throughout Europe. The letters
in our modern copy-books may be regarded as their
direct, though degenerate, descendants.</p>

<p><em class="italic">SLANTED-PEN or TILTED WRITING.</em>—The
forms of the letters in early writing indicate
an easily held pen—slanted away from the right
shoulder. The slanted pen naturally produced
<em class="italic">oblique</em> thick strokes and thin strokes, and the letters
were “tilted” (see fig.
<a href="#fig09">9</a>).</p>

<p>In the highly finished hands—used from the
sixth to the eighth centuries—such as the later
Uncials and the Roman, Irish, and English Half-Uncials,
the pen was manipulated or cut so that
the thin strokes were approximately horizontal,
and the thick strokes vertical (fig.
<a href="#fig10">10</a>). The
earlier and easier practice came into fashion again
in the eighth and ninth centuries, and the round
Irish and English hands became “pointed” as a
result of slanting the pen.</p>

<p>The alteration in widths and directions of pen
strokes, due to the use of the “slanted pen,” had these
effects on the half-uncial forms (see fig.
<span class="nowrap"><a href="#fig11">11</a>):—</span></p>

<p>1. <em class="italic">The thin strokes taking an oblique</em> (<em class="italic">upward</em>)
<em class="italic">direction</em> (<em class="italic">a</em>) (giving a sharp angle with the verticals
(<em class="italic">d</em>, <em class="italic">a</em>)) led to angularity and narrower forms
(<em class="italic">a</em><sup>1</sup>), and a marked contrast between thick and
thin strokes—due to the abrupt change from one
to the other (<em class="italic">a</em><sup>2</sup>).</p>

<p>2. <em class="italic">The thick strokes becoming oblique</em> (<em class="italic">b</em>) caused a
thickening of the curves below on the left (<em class="italic">b</em><sup>1</sup>),
and above on the right (<em class="italic">b</em><sup>2</sup>), which gave heavy
shoulders and feet.</p>

<p>3. <em class="italic">The horizontal strokes becoming thicker</em> (<em class="italic">c</em>) gave
stronger and less elegant forms.

<p><em class="italic">TENTH, ELEVENTH, AND TWELFTH
CENTURY WRITING.</em>—The easy use of the
slanted pen, and the lateral compression of the
letters which naturally followed, resulted in a valuable
economy of time and space in the making of
books. This lateral compression is strongly marked
in the tenth century (see fig.
<a href="#fig12">12</a>), and in the
eleventh and twelfth centuries it caused curves
to give place to angles, and writing to become
“<em class="italic">Gothic</em>” in character (see <a href="#plate11">Plate XI.</a>).</p>

fifteenth century writing grew larger and taller
again, but the letters had steadily become
<span class="xxpn" id="p047"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p047]</a></span>
narrower, more angular, and stiffer, till the written
page consisted of rows of perpendicular thick strokes
with heads and feet connected by oblique hair-lines—which
often look as if they had been dashed in
after with a fine pen—all made with an almost
mechanical precision (see <a href="#plate17">Plate XVII.</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">ITALIAN WRITING.</em>—In Italy alone the
roundness of the earlier hands was preserved, and
though in course of time the letters were affected
by the “Gothic” tendency, they never lost the
curved forms or acquired the extreme angularity
which is seen in the writings of Northern Europe
(compare Plates
<a href="#plate10">X.</a> and
<a href="#plate11">XI.</a>).</p>

<p>At the time of the Renaissance the Italian scribes
remodelled their “hands” on the beautiful Italian
writing of the eleventh and twelfth centuries (see
Plates <a href="#plate10">X.</a> and <a href="#plate18">XVIII.</a>,
<a href="#plate19">XIX.</a>, <a href="#plate20">XX.</a>). The early
Italian printers followed after the scribes and
modelled their types on these round clear letters.
And thus the fifteenth century Italian formal
writing became the foundation of the “<em class="italic">Roman</em>”
<em class="italic">small letters</em>, which have superseded all others for
the printing of books.
<span class="xxpn" id="p048"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p048]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">ITALICS.</em>—The Roman Letters, together with

href="#fig178">316</a>, <a href="#p483">483</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">ORNAMENTAL LETTERS</em> originated in
the simple written forms, which were developed

<h4>ACQUIRING A FORMAL HAND: TOOLS, &#38;C.</h4>

<p class="first">The simplest way of learning how to make
letters is to acquire a fine formal hand. To this
end a legible and beautiful writing (see p.
<a href="#p070">70</a>)
should be chosen, and be carefully copied with a
properly cut pen.</p>

<p><em class="italic">For learning to write</em>, the following tools and
materials are <span class="nowrap">required:—</span></p>

<ul>
<li>Desk.</li>
<li>Writing-paper.</li>
<li>Ink and <em class="italic">filler</em>.</li>
<li>Pens (Reed and Quill) with “<em class="italic">springs</em>.” <span class="xxpn" id="p049"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p049]</a></span></li>
<li>Pen-knife, sharpening-stone, and <em class="italic">cutting-slab</em>.</li>
<li>Magnifying glass.</li>
<li>Two-foot (preferably <em class="italic">three-foot</em>) rule, and pencil.</li>
<li>Linen pen-wiper.</li>
</ul>

<h4>THE DESK</h4>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig14">
<img src="images/i049.jpg" width="600" height="606" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">

<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 15.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>An ordinary desk or drawing-board can be used,
but the best desk is made by hinging a drawing-board
(“Imperial” size) to the edge of a table.
The board may be raised and supported at any
desired angle by a hinged support, or by a <em class="italic">round</em>
tin set under it (fig.
<a href="#fig14">14</a>). For a more portable
<span class="xxpn" id="p050"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p050]</a></span>
desk two drawing-boards may be similarly hinged
together and placed
on a table (fig.
<a href="#fig15">15</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig16">
<img src="images/i050b.jpg" width="600" height="445" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 16.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A tape or string is
tightly stretched—horizontally—across
the desk to hold the
writing-paper (which,
as a rule, is not pinned
on). The lower part
of the writing-paper
is held and protected
by a piece of stout
paper or vellum fixed
tightly, with drawing-pins, across and over it
(fig.
<a href="#fig16">16</a>). Under the writing-paper there should
be a “<em class="italic">writing-pad</em>,” consisting of one or two
<span class="xxpn" id="p051"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p051]</a></span>
sheets of blotting-paper, or some other suitable
substance.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>It is a good plan to have the lower, front edge
of the desk bevelled or rounded, so that the tail
part of a deep sheet, which may hang below the
table, does not become accidentally creased by
being pressed against it. A curved piece of cardboard
fixed on the edge will answer the same
purpose.</p>


<h4>PAPER &#38; INK</h4>

<p>For “practice” any smooth—not glazed—paper
will do. For careful work a smooth <em class="italic">hand-made</em>
paper is best (pp. <a href="#p103">103</a>, <a
href="#p111">111</a>).</p>

<p>A good, prepared, liquid (carbon) ink is best. It
should be as black as possible, without being too
thick. A jet-black ink will test the quality of the
writing by “showing up” all the faults; “pale”
or “tinted” inks rather conceal the faults, and
lend a false appearance of excellence (p.
<a href="#p322">322</a>). A
thin ink greatly adds to the ease of writing (see
<em class="italic"><a href="#addenda">Addenda</a></em>, p.
<a href="#addenda">23</a>). Waterproof inks, as a rule, are too
thick or gummy, and do not flow freely enough.</p>

<p>The ink-bottle is kept corked when not in use,
to keep the ink clean and prevent evaporation.
Thick or muddy ink should be put away: it is
not worth while trying to use it.</p>

<p>A small brush is used for filling the pen.</p>

<p>III. The nib already has a slit usually about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
inch long. This is sufficient in a fairly pliant
pen; in a very stiff pen (see p.

lengthened to
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>

care by holding a <em class="italic">half-nib</em> between the forefinger
<span class="xxpn" id="p056"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p056]</a></span>
and thumb of each hand, but the safest way is to

another pen (or a brush-handle) as explained under
<em class="italic">Reed</em>, V. (see p.

<p>IV. The sides of the nib are pared till the width
across the tip is rather less than the width
desired<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>

<p>V. The nib is laid, back up, on the glass slab,
and the extreme tip is cut off obliquely to the slit,
the knife blade being slightly sloped, and its edge
forming an angle of about 70° with the line of
the shaft (fig.
<a href="#fig29">29</a>; see also fig.
<a href="#fig36">36</a>).

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 29.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>The shaft rests lightly in the left hand (not <em
class="italic">gripped</em> and not pressed down on slab at all),
and the knife blade is entered with a steady pressure.</p>

<p>If the nib is then not wide enough it may be cut again; if too
wide, the sides may be pared down.</p>

<p>Cut very little at a time off the tip of the nib; a heavy cut
is apt to force the pen out of shape and spoil the edge of the
nib.</p>

<p>VI. The nib should then be examined with the magnifying glass.
Hold the pen, back down, over a sheet of white paper, and see
that the ends of the two half-nibs are in the same straight line
<em class="italic">a</em>–<em class="italic">b</em> (fig.
<a href="#fig30">30</a>).</p>

<p>The nib should have an oblique chisel-shaped tip, very sharply
cut (fig. <a href="#fig31">31</a>).</p>

<p>A magnifying glass is necessary for examining a fine pen; a
coarse pen may be held up against <span class="xxpn" id="p058"><a
class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p058]</a></span> the light
from a window—a finger-tip being held just over the nib to direct
the eye (fig. <a href="#fig32">32</a>).</p>

<p>VII. The <em class="italic">Spring</em> (see <em

inch by
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch)
is placed so that the point is about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">16</span></span>
inch from the end of
the nib. The long loop should be made rather flat to hold plenty
of ink (A, fig.
<a href="#fig35">35</a>)—neither too much curved (B: this holds only a
drop), nor quite flat (C: this draws the ink up and away from the
nib).</p>

<h4>OF QUILLS GENERALLY</h4>

<p>For ordinary use the nib may be cut with a fairly
steep angle, as shown
(magnified) at (<em class="italic">a</em>) (fig.
<a href="#fig36">36</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft isize4" id="fig36">
<img src="images/i059b.jpg" width="250" height="356" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 36.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>But it is better for fine,
sharp writing that the
angle be made very
sharp: the knife blade
is laid back (much flatter
than is shown in fig.
<a href="#fig29">29</a>) and the quill is cut
quite thin; the knife
blade is then held vertical
and the extreme tip
of the nib is cut off sharp
and true (<em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig36">36</a>).</p>

<p>For large writing, the
curved inside of the quill is pared <em class="italic">flat</em> (<em class="italic">c</em>,
<em class="italic">d</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig36">36</a>)
<span class="xxpn" id="p060"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p060]</a></span>
to give full strokes. If the nib be left curved and
hollow underneath (<em class="italic">e</em>), it is apt to make hollow
strokes.</p>

<p>The pen may be made more <em class="italic">pliant</em> by scraping
it till it is thinner, or by cutting the “shoulder”
(<em class="italic">a</em>–<em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig29">29</a>) longer, or <em class="italic">stiffer</em> by cutting the nib
back until the “shoulder” is short.</p>

<p>Goose and Crow Quills (see p.
<a href="#p172">172</a>).</p>

<p>The main advantages of a quill over a metal pen
are, that the former may be shaped exactly as the
writer desires, and be re-cut when it becomes blunt.</p>

<p>A metal pen may be sharpened on an oilstone,
but the process takes so much longer that there is
no saving in time: it is not easily cut to the exact
shape, and it lacks the pleasant elasticity of the quill.</p>

<p>A gold pen is probably the best substitute for a
quill, and if it were possible to have a sharp,
“chisel-edged” <em class="italic">iridium</em> tip on the gold nib, it
would be an extremely convenient form of pen.
A “fountain pen” might be used with thin ink.</p>

<h4>POSITION OF THE DESK</h4>

<div class="figleft isize4" id="fig38">
<img src="images/i062a.jpg" width="250" height="464" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 38.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p class="first"><em class="italic">Always write at a slope.</em>
This enables you to sit up comfortably at your work, and to
see the MS. clearly as though it were on an easel—and, by the
resulting horizontal position of the pen, the ink is kept under
control. It may be seen from ancient pictures that this was the
method of the scribes (see <em class="italic">Frontispiece</em>).
Never write on a flat table; it causes the writer to stoop, the
MS. is seen foreshortened, and the ink flows out of the pen
too rapidly. <span class="xxpn" id="p062"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p062]</a></span></p>

<p>The slope of the desk may be about, or rather less than, 45°
to begin with: as the hand becomes accustomed to it, it may be
raised to about 60° (fig. <a href="#fig38">38</a>).</p>

<p>The “heel” of the right hand may be tired at first, but
it soon grows used to the position. A rest for the left
arm, if necessary, can be attached to the left side of the
board.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Lighting.</em> The desk is
placed very near to a window,
so that a strong light
falls on it from the left.
Direct sunlight may be
cut off by fixing a sheet
of thin white paper in the
window. <em class="italic">Careful work
should be done by daylight.</em>
Work done by artificial
light always appears faulty
and unsatisfactory when
viewed by day.</p>

<h4>THE WRITING LEVEL</h4>

<div class="figright isize4" id="fig39">
<img src="images/i062b.jpg" width="250" height="155" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 39.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Each penman will find
for himself the <em class="italic">writing
level</em> along which his
pen will move most naturally and conveniently
(see figs.
<a href="#fig39">39</a> and <a href="#fig16">16</a>). The <em class="italic">paper guard</em>
should be pinned on about 1 inch below the
<span class="xxpn" id="p063"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p063]</a></span>
writing level: the <em class="italic">tape</em> is fixed across about 3
inches above the guard. In the case of very
large writing the space between the tape and the
guard is greater, and in the case of a very small
MS. it is less.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The writing level is kept constant.</em> When one
line has been written, the writing paper—which
is placed behind the tape and the guard—is pulled
up for another line.</p>

<h4>USE OF THE PEN</h4>

<p>For the practical study of pen-forms use a cane
or a reed pen—or a quill cut very broad—giving
a broad, firm, thick stroke. It is the chisel edge
(p.
<a href="#p057">57</a>) of the nib which gives the “clean cut”
thick and thin strokes and the graduated curved
strokes characteristic of good writing (fig.
<a href="#fig40">40</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s4" id="fig40">
<img src="images/i063.jpg" width="250" height="186" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 40.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Therefore, <em class="italic">let the nib glide about on the surface
with the least possible pressure</em>, making natural
pen-strokes the thickness of which is only varied
<span class="xxpn" id="p064"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p064]</a></span>
by the different directions in which the nib
moves (see <em class="italic">Addenda</em>, p.
<a href="#addenda">23</a>).</p>

<p>It is very important that the nib be cut “sharp,”
and as often as its edge wears blunt it must be resharpened.
It is impossible to make “clean cut”
strokes with a blunt pen (see <em class="italic">Addenda</em>, p.
<a href="#pxv">25</a>).</p>

<p>When the nib is cut back, the “shoulder”
should be cut back to preserve the elasticity of
the pen (p.
<a href="#p060">60</a>).</p>

<h4>HOLDING THE PEN</h4>

<p><em class="italic">The hand holds the pen lightly and easily.</em>
A good method is to loop the thumb and forefinger
over, and slightly gripping, the shaft of the
pen, and support the shaft from below with the
second finger. The third and fourth fingers are
tucked, out of the way, into the palm (figs.
<a href="#fig41">41</a>, <a href="#fig45">45</a>).</p>

<p>The pen should be so lightly held that <em class="italic">the act of
writing should draw the edge of the nib into perfect
contact with the paper, both the half-nibs touching the
surface</em>. (To make sure that the contact is perfect,
make experimental thick strokes on a scrap of
paper—pinned at the right-hand side of the desk—and
see that they are “true,” <em class="italic">i.e.</em> that they are
of even width, with “clean cut” edges and ends.)
The writer should be able to feel what the nib is
doing. If the pen be gripped stiffly the edge of
the nib cannot be felt on the paper; and it will
inevitably be forced out of shape and prematurely
blunted.</p>

<p>A thin slip of bone—a “folder” or the handle
of the pen-knife will do—is commonly held in the
left hand to keep the paper flat and steady (see
fig.
<a href="#fig41">41</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p065"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p065]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">THE CUSTOMARY MANNER.</em>—The
ancient scribe probably held his pen in the manner
most convenient to himself; and we, in order to
write with freedom, should hold the pen in the
way to which, by long use, we have been accustomed;
<em class="italic">provided that, for writing an upright round-hand,
the pen be so manipulated and cut as to make fine
horizontal thin strokes and clean vertical thick strokes</em>
(see fig.
<a href="#fig40">40</a>, &#38; <em class="italic">footnote</em>, p.
<a href="#p304">304</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig41">
<img src="images/i065.jpg" width="600" height="496" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 41.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">SLANTED SHAFT, &#38;c.</em>—Most people
are accustomed to holding a pen slanted away from the right
shoulder. The nib therefore is cut at <span class="xxpn"
id="p066"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p066]</a></span>
an oblique angle<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#footnote_13"
class="fnanchor">13</a> to the shaft, so that, while the shaft
is slanted, <em class="italic">the edge of the nib is parallel
with the horizontal line of the paper</em>, and will therefore
produce a horizontal thin stroke and a vertical thick stroke.
For example: if the shaft is held slanted at an angle of 70°
with the horizontal, the nib is cut at an angle of 70° with
the shaft (fig. <a href="#fig42">42</a>). The angle of the nib
with the shaft may vary from 90° (at right angles) to about
70°, according to the slant at which the shaft is held (fig. <a
href="#fig43">43</a>).</p>

</div></div>
</div></div><!--end table-->

<p>If the writer prefers
an extremely
slanted shaft, to cut
the nib correspondingly
obliquely would
weaken it, so it is better to counteract the slant by
slightly tilting the paper (fig.
<a href="#fig44">44</a>).</p>

<p class="keepout">To produce the <em class="italic">horizontal
thin stroke</em>, therefore:</p>

<ul>
<li><em class="italic">The slant at which the shaft is

<p class="continue" id="p067">must be so adjusted, one to
another, that the chisel edge of the nib is parallel to the
horizontal line of the paper. Before writing, make trial strokes

strokes should be square ended and the full width of the nib, the
horizontal strokes as fine as possible.</p>

<h4>MODELS</h4>

<p class="first">The best training is found in the practice of an

a writing, the penman can acquire any other hands—sloping

<p>The English Half-Uncial writing in <a href="#plate07">Plate VII.</a>
is an excellent model. Those who have sufficient
time to spare for the careful study of this, or any
other legible and beautiful round-hand, should

easier to begin with a simplified and modernised
writing, such as Script I. (fig.

<p>Before copying a hand it is well to examine carefully
the manuscript from which it is taken: observe
its general appearance: note the character and
mode of the ruling, and the sizes and relative proportions
of page, text, margins, and ornaments.
With regard to the actual forms of the letters and
the mode of their arrangement, such a method of
analysis as the following will be found useful, as an
aid to accuracy in copying, and definiteness in self-criticism.

<p>The pen generally is held so as to give approximately horizontal
thin strokes (see p.
<a href="#p066">66</a>), but in making <em class="bold">v</em>
(<em class="bold">w</em>, <em class="bold">y</em>) and <em
class="bold">x</em>, parts of <em class="bold">z</em>, &#38;c., it
is “slanted.” In figs.
<a href="#fig51">51</a> and <a href="#fig57">57</a>
these forms are marked with a small
diagonal cross × (see also p.
<a href="#pxxv">25</a>).</p>

<p>Most of the strokes begin as <em class="italic">down-strokes</em>,
but at the <em class="italic">end</em> of a <em
class="italic">down-stroke</em>, when the ink is flowing
freely, the stroke may be continued in an upward direction (as
in <em class="italic">coupling-strokes</em>, &#38;c., the <em
class="italic">feet</em> of letters, the thin stroke of <em
class="bold">x</em>, and, if preferred, in making the last stroke
of <em class="bold">g</em>, <em class="bold">s</em>, and <em
class="bold">y</em>).</p>

<p>While the ink is still wet in a <em
class="italic">down-stroke</em>, the nib may be replaced on it and
be pushed <em class="italic">up</em>ward and outward to form the
round arch in <em class="bold">b</em>, <em class="bold">h</em>,
<em class="bold">m</em>, <em class="bold">n</em>, <em
class="bold">p</em>, and <em class="bold">r</em>. This stroke,
reversed, is also used for the top of <em class="bold">t</em>.</p>

<h4>COUPLING THE LETTERS</h4>

<p>The letters are joined together by means of
their <em class="italic">coupling-strokes</em>, which for this purpose may
be slightly drawn out, and forward, from the
naturally round forms of the letters (see <em class="bold">c</em>, <em class="bold">e</em>, &#38;c.,
fig.
<a href="#fig52">52</a> &#38; fig.
<a href="#fig59">59</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig52">
<img src="images/i076.jpg" width="587" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 52.</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The <em class="italic">coupling-strokes</em> are finishing strokes—and as
such are akin to <em class="italic">serifs</em> (p.
<a href="#p244">244</a>)—growing out of or
added to such stems as need “finishing.”</p>

<p>Coupling enables one to write faster and with
<span class="xxpn" id="p076"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p076]</a></span>
more freedom, the concluding or “coupling” stroke
not being <em class="italic">slowed down</em>, but written with a dash,
which is covered by the first stroke of the succeeding
<span class="xxpn" id="p077"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p077]</a></span>
letter. It keeps the individual words more
distinct, and therefore permits closer spacing of the
text. Coupling is for convenience <em class="italic">and</em> legibility,
and where it tends to interfere with legibility, we
must be careful. The freer and more <em class="italic">cursive</em> the
hand, the greater is the tendency to join and run
letters together, as in ordinary writing.</p>

<p>It is preferable to couple letters below, if possible.
Couplings above are sometimes apt to confuse the
reading; for example, the cross-bar of <em class="bold">t</em> (though
the most natural coupling for the scribe to use—see
<em class="italic">petatis</em>, <a href="#plate07">Plate VII.</a>) should generally be made to
pass over or fall short of the succeeding letter (see
fig.
<a href="#fig52">52</a>).</p>

<h4>SPACING: LETTERS, WORDS, &#38; LINES</h4>

<p>The letters of a word are fitted together so
that there is a general effect of evenness. This
evenness is only to be attained by practice: it is
characteristic of rapid skilful writing, and cannot
be produced satisfactorily by any system of measurement
while the writer’s hand is still slow and
uncertain. It is worth noting, however, that the
white interspaces vary slightly, while the actual
distances between the letters vary considerably,
according to whether the adjacent strokes curve (or
slant) away or are perpendicular (figs.
<a href="#fig53">53</a>, <a href="#fig152">152</a>).</p>

<p>It is sufficient for the beginner to take care that
two curved letters are made very near each other,
and that two straight strokes are spaced well apart.</p>

<p>If the curves are too far apart there will be spots
of light, and where several heavy stems are made
too close together, “blots” of dark, marring the
evenness of the page.

<h4>OF <em class="italic">COPYING</em> MSS. GENERALLY</h4>

<p>When copying a MS. it is best to choose a
complete page—or part of a page—to be copied in
facsimile.</p>

<p>Two or three lines are copied to begin with;
then the composition of the individual letters and
words is studied by means of a large pen; and
finally the whole page is copied in facsimile. (Of
<em class="italic">practising</em>, see pp. <a href="#p085">85</a>,
<a href="#p086">86</a>).</p>

<p>Make a general examination and analysis as
suggested at p.
<a href="#p071">71</a>. Accurate measurements will
be found helpful.</p>

<p>Take the heights of the <em class="bold">o</em> and the <em class="bold">d</em>, and the
distance apart of the writing-lines with dividers
<span class="xxpn" id="p083"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p083]</a></span>
The width of the thick stroke is best found by
making experimental thick strokes—the <em class="italic">full width</em>
of the pen nib—on a scrap of paper: cut the paper
in half across the thick strokes, and place the cut
edge on the <em class="italic">thickest</em> strokes in the original MS., you
will then find whether the pen nib should be cut
wider or narrower.</p>

<p>The direction of the <em class="italic">thickest</em> strokes is approximately
at right angles to the direction of the thin
strokes; which commonly approaches the horizontal
in early round hands, and is oblique in other hands
(see fig.
<a href="#fig09">9</a> and <a href="#fig10">10</a>). The positions both of these
strokes in the model, and of your pen, determine the
angle of the nib. Therefore, <em class="italic">cut the nib across at such
an angle to the shaft of the pen that, when you hold the
pen naturally, the direction of the thin strokes which it
makes on the writing paper will coincide with the direction
of the thin strokes in the model</em>; but</p>

<ul>
<li>(<em class="italic">a</em>) The way in which the shaft is held,</li>
<li>(<em class="italic">b</em>) The angle at which the nib is cut,</li>
<li>(<em class="italic">c</em>) The position of the writing paper,</li>
</ul>

<p class="continue">may all be slightly varied, so that the direction of
the thin strokes can be followed exactly (see p.
<a href="#p066">66</a>).</p>

<p>The writing paper is cut and ruled exactly in
accordance with the model; and the heights of the
letters and the widths of the thick strokes in the
copy agree as nearly as possible with those in the
original. It is therefore a good test for accuracy—<em class="italic">when
a few lines of writing have been copied</em>—to
measure and compare their lengths. If they correspond
with their originals, it goes far to prove the
copy a good one.</p>

<p>Before copying more of the page, the construction
of the letters should be carefully studied. The
number and the forms of pen-strokes in each letter
<span class="xxpn" id="p084"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p084]</a></span>
are found by examination—with a magnifying glass
if necessary—and by the experimental putting together
of strokes, to form a similar letter. For this
a large pen, such as a reed, is useful, and it is a good
plan to write individual letters and words exactly
two, three, or four times their <em class="italic">height</em> in the model:
both the pen nib and the individual letters are made
correspondingly two, three, or four times as <em class="italic">wide</em> as
in the original.</p>

<p>It is particularly important, in copying, to preserve
accurately the proportion of the <em class="italic">thick stroke</em> to
the <em class="italic">height and width</em> of a letter (see p.
<a href="#p324">324</a>). These
are conveniently measured by the pen nib itself, or
by the estimated width of the thick stroke; thus,
in the writing shown in fig.
<a href="#fig50">50</a>, the <em class="italic">width</em> of the <em class="bold">o</em>
is approximately <em class="italic">five</em>, and the <em class="italic">height</em> approximately
<em class="italic">four</em>, times the width of the thick stroke.</p>

<p>Not only must the copier ascertain what the
forms are like and what are their proportions, but
he must try to find out <em class="italic">how they were made</em>. This
is of the greatest importance, for the manner of
making a letter, or even a single stroke, affects its
form and character with a definite tendency (see
p.
<a href="#p416">416</a> &#38; fig.
<a href="#fig172">172</a>). And this becomes more marked
the faster the writing. An apparently right form
may yet be wrongly—if slowly—made; but in
rapid writing, a wrong manner of handling the pen
will inevitably produce wrong forms. As the real
virtue of penmanship is attained only when we can
write quickly, it is well worth training the hand
from the beginning in the proper manner.</p>

<p>Patient and careful examination should be made
of the changing pen-strokes, and of the mode in
which they join—to form letters—and begin and end—to
form “heads” and “feet.” This, accompanied
<span class="xxpn" id="p085"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p085]</a></span>
by practical experiments in cutting and handling the
pen, will bring out details of the utmost technical
value. A certain amount of legitimate “faking”
(p.
<a href="#p246">246</a>), play of the pen, and sleight of hand (p.
<a href="#p311">311</a>),
may be found, but, in the main, the regular, natural,
<em class="italic">thick</em> and <em class="italic">thin</em> strokes of the pen, and the orderly
arrangement of the writing, give to a manuscript
its beauty and character.</p>

<p>Then having cut the nib rightly, you may, in a
sense, <em class="italic">let the pen do the writing</em>, while you merely
follow the strokes of the model, and you will, in
course of time, have the pleasure of seeing the same
beautiful writing—in the very manner of the ancient
scribes—growing under your own hand.</p>

<h4>PRACTICE</h4>

<p class="first">In acquiring a formal writing the penman should
have two paper books constantly in hand: one for
the study of the forms of letters, the other for both
the letters and their arrangement. The first should
contain large and very carefully made writing—with
perhaps only one word to the line; the second
<span class="xxpn" id="p086"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p086]</a></span>
should have smaller and quicker writing, neatly
arranged on the pages, with four or five words to
the line. (See MS. Books, Chap. VI.)</p>

<p>A broad nib is used in preference to a narrow
one, so that the characteristics of true pen-work
are brought out and the faults made clear. A fine,
light handwriting is often very pretty, but it is
certain to mislead the novice in penmanship (see
p.
<a href="#p324">324</a>).</p>

<p>Having acquired a formal hand the penman may
modify and alter it, taking care that the changes
are compatible, and that they do not impair its
legibility or beauty. Such letters as are obsolete he
replaces by legible forms akin to them in feeling,
and, the style of the selected type becoming very
naturally and almost unconsciously modified by
personal use, he at length attains an appropriate
and modern Formal-Handwriting. The process of
“forming” a hand requires time and practice: it
resembles the
passage of
“Copy-book”
into “Running”
hand,
familiar to us
all (see p.
<a href="#p323">323</a>).</p>

</div>

<h4>SCRIPTS I. &#38; II.</h4>

<p>Having cut
the nib of a
reed or large
quill to the
exact width required for the thick stroke, copy the
component strokes of the letter
<img class="letter5" src="images/i086c1.jpg" width="90" height="90" alt="alpha" />
(Script I.), and
<span class="xxpn" id="p087"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p087]</a></span>
immediately make the complete letter: go through
the whole alphabet in this way several times (fig.
<a href="#fig58">58</a>). Next join the letters together (see p.
<a href="#p073">73</a>)
<span class="xxpn" id="p088"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p088]</a></span>
to form words—writing always between ruled lines
(fig.
<a href="#fig59">59</a> &#38; p.
<a href="#p414">414</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig59">
<img src="images/i087a.jpg" width="600" height="182" alt="" />

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 60.</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Script II. is similarly practised: the letters are
<em class="italic">grouped</em> (p.
<a href="#p082">82</a>) to form words (fig.
<a href="#fig60">60</a>).</p>

<p>Next make a neat page of large writing, and,
if possible, write such a page every day. The more
definite and methodical practice is, the better.
“Practising” <em class="italic">anyhow</em>, on scraps of paper, does
more harm than good.</p>

</div>

<h4>ARRANGING &#38; RULING A SINGLE SHEET</h4>

<p>The <em class="italic">size</em> of an inscription is commonly settled
before the arrangement of the text is planned out,
being determined by considerations of its future
position and office, or by custom and use (see
pp. <a href="#p100">100</a>–<a
href="#p103">103</a> &#38; <a href="#p351">351</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p089"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p089]</a></span></p>

<p>The proportions of the writing, spacing, and
margins will likewise properly <em class="italic">settle themselves</em> (see
pp. <a href="#p265">265</a>, <a
href="#p103">103</a>, <a href="#p107">107</a>), but where the size of the sheet
only is fixed, we have, broadly speaking, to decide
between “large” writing with “small” margins
(fig.
<a href="#fig61">61</a>), and “small” writing with “large” margins
(fig.
<a href="#fig62">62</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig62">
<img src="images/i089.jpg" width="600" height="435" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 62.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Generally a compromise is arrived at and the
proportions are more evenly balanced (fig.
<a href="#fig63">63</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Ruling</em> (see also pp. <a href="#p258">258</a>,
<a href="#p099">99</a>).—The mode of ruling
<em class="italic">marginal lines</em> and <em class="italic">writing lines</em> is shown in fig.
<a href="#fig65">65</a>.
The ruling should be light, but firm and accurate.
A fine pen, or hard pencil, or a blunt point may be
used. Where the <em class="italic">writing lines</em> are double (as for
<em class="italic">round</em> hands, p.
<a href="#p304">304</a>), it is best to have a double
ruling point (see fig.
<a href="#fig77">77</a>). Two hard pencils firmly
<span class="xxpn" id="p090"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p090]</a></span>

and these are measured to find the area which the
whole text so written would occupy (fig.

<p>Frequently it is desirable first to determine the
sizes of the margins. These depend on various
considerations of the position and office of the MS.,
but more particularly on the size of the sheet and
the character of its future
environment<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> (see p.
<a href="#p351">351</a>).</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">top</em> and <em class="italic">side margins</em> may be of equal width—or
the <em class="italic">top</em> may be a little less (see <em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig70">70</a>). Ample
space should be allowed for the <em class="italic">foot margin</em>, which
is generally about twice the width of the <em class="italic">top</em>, but
may vary in different cases, according as the text
falls short of or encroaches upon it (see pp. <a href="#p352">352</a>, <a
href="#p342">342</a>).
For a plain <em class="italic">foolscap</em> sheet: <em class="italic">sides</em> (each)
<span class="mixfract">2<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches,
<em class="italic">top</em> (approx.) 2 inches, and <em class="italic">foot</em> (approx.) 4 inches,
may be taken as suitable margins (fig.

<p>A poem has a given number of lines of various
lengths, and only very strong reason or necessity
can justify our altering its proper form (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> by
breaking up the lines) in order to make a mass of
equal lines. Such theoretical margins as are possible
in the treatment of prose can therefore seldom
be observed in writing out a poem, and, unless the
height or the width of the sheet can be altered, there
is apt to be an excess of margin in one or the other
direction. When such excess margin is obviously
unavoidable, no objection can be made to its appearance.
<em class="italic">Poetry may conveniently be treated as “fine
writing”</em> (see p.
<a href="#p263">263</a>).</p>

<p>If the size of the writing be considered of the
first importance, several of the <em class="italic">longer lines</em> (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> the
first and the eleventh in the poem given) are written
on a piece of paper in the size of writing preferred
(say,
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
inch). By laying this paper on the given
sheet, it is seen whether such lines would allow of
sufficient <em class="italic">side margins</em>. (If they would not, the
writing may be made smaller.)</p>

<p>The height of the writing
<span class="nowrap">(<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span>

<p><em class="italic">The Sizes of the Margins.</em>—It will be seen that
the above method is primarily for settling <em class="italic">a length

The process can be reversed; if necessary, the side
margins are made of a given width, thus determining
the exact length of the line, <em class="italic">the size of

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The <em class="italic">extra</em> long lines may slightly encroach
on the right-hand margin: the effect of
this is balanced by the falling short of other lines.</p>

<h4>SPACING &#38; PLANNING MANUSCRIPT</h4>

<p>In penmanship great nicety of spacing and
arrangement is possible. The <em class="italic">ascending</em> and <em class="italic">descending</em>
strokes may be shortened or drawn out,
the spaces between letters and words may be
slightly increased or decreased, the lines may be
written near or far apart, and the letters may
be written with a broader or narrower nib.</p>

<p>Elaborate spacing and planning, however, should
not be attempted at first, and straightforward,
undesigned work is often the best. The student
is apt to waste time writing out an elaborate draft
<span class="xxpn" id="p098"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p098]</a></span>
in order to ascertain how to space the matter.
This is a mistake, because if written well, it is a
waste of good writing on a mere draft; if written
ill, it is bad practice. The briefer experiments
and calculations are, the better, though the simplest
problem always requires for its solution a calculation
or <em class="italic">process of guess and trial</em> (such as suggested in
the preceding pages). Practice will make people
very good <em class="italic">guessers</em>, and the best work of all is done
when the worker guesses rightly, and follows his
guesses with the actual work, itself the trial and
proof of accuracy.</p>

sheet the size of a page of the book, and clip the long edge

bound). If the page will bend over and stay down by its own

it is too stiff.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cutting Sheets.</em>—A frame or template (the size

It is useful for cutting out the sheets for a common

<p><em class="italic">Folding.</em>—A <em class="italic">Folder</em>, as used by bookbinders (or

be used. Or the ruling—of the writing lines—may
be simplified by using a stout card frame
(internally the size of the text-column) with strips
glued across it: for a common size of book this
might be made in stout tin or other metal. The
lines are commonly ruled with a <em class="italic">ruling stylus</em> (see

<h4>METHODS &#38; PROPORTIONS</h4>

<p>Having to make a manuscript book for a specific
purpose, the scribe formulates in his mind a general
plan of the work, and decides approximately the
respective sizes of page and of writing which seem
most suitable.</p>

<p>He endeavours to fashion the book in accord
with its use, and therefore allows the (most suitable)
material, the subject-matter and the office of the
book, and the way in which it will be read and
handled, to determine as far as is possible the proportions
of its parts, and its treatment as a whole.</p>

<p>Its <em class="italic">material</em> may be vellum, parchment, or paper,
on which a variety of pens, brushes, and other tools,
with inks, colours, and metal foils, may be employed.
Its <em class="italic">office</em> may be “useful” or “ornamental”; its
contents may be long or short, weighty or light,
and of greater or less worth; it may be for public
or for private use; and the book may be intended
to be placed on a lectern, to be held in the hand,
or to be carried in a coat pocket.</p>

<p>In following out such natural indications, the
<span class="xxpn" id="p101"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p101]</a></span>
practised craftsman relies greatly on his working
methods, preferring a direct mode of treatment to
one which is too ingenious or subtle. In deciding
a doubtful point, a common-sense of proportion is
a sufficient guide, and one may generally assume
that great works are best “writ large,” and that
large letters look best on an ample page, and <em class="italic">vice
versâ</em>.</p>

<p>The main proportions which have to be considered
are interdependent, and follow one another
in their natural order (see p.
<a href="#p256">256</a>), <span class="nowrap">thus—</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. <em class="italic">The size and shape of the book.</em></li>
<li>2. <em class="italic">The widths of the margins.</em></li>
<li>3. <em class="italic">The size of the writing</em>, &#38;c.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the methodical scribe makes his books of
certain definite and regular sizes, each size having
corresponding and regular proportions of margins
and writing. Though these may greatly depend
on individual taste and experience, it is suggested
that—like all good designs—they should be allowed
as far as possible to <em class="italic">settle and arrange themselves</em>.</p>

<h4>THE SIZE &#38; SHAPE OF THE BOOK</h4>

<p>A book is thought of by the scribe chiefly as an
open book, and the width and height of its pages
are chosen with a view to its convenient shape
and pleasant appearance when open. The most
economical sizes into which a suitable sheet of
paper can be folded (or a skin of parchment can
be cut) may commonly be allowed to decide these
proportions.</p>

<p>When a printer is about to print a book he
chooses a sheet of paper which will fold into a
suitable shape and size. If the sheet be folded
<span class="xxpn" id="p102"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p102]</a></span>
once to form two leaves, the book is called a <em class="italic">folio</em>
(fig.
<a href="#fig69">69</a>); folded again to form a “<em class="italic">section</em>” of four
leaves—a <em class="italic">quarto</em> (4to); or folded a third time to
form a <em class="italic">section</em> of eight leaves—an <em class="italic">octavo</em>
(8vo).<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p103"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p103]</a></span>
The book is made up of a number of sections
sewn on to strings or tapes (see p.
<a href="#p347">347</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig69">
<img src="images/i102.jpg" width="600" height="714" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 69.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>The penman will find that, besides saving time
and labour, it conduces to good work if he keep to
certain regular sizes for “large,” “medium,” and
“small” books; and, if the ordinary sheets of
paper which he uses will fold in convenient <em class="italic">folio</em>,
<em class="italic">quarto</em>, and <em class="italic">octavo</em> sizes, it is well that he make
these his standards for paper books.</p>

<p>Paper being made in sheets of various dimensions,
by folding a large or a small sheet, a “large”
or “small” folio—4to, 8vo—can be obtained.</p>

<p>It may be noted that the length and the width
of sheets of
paper<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> are very commonly <em class="italic">about as 9 is
to 7</em>. And therefore, when the sheet is folded for
<em class="italic">folio</em> or <em class="italic">octavo</em>, the proportions are roughly about
7:
<span class="mixfract">4<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>,</span> which are very good proportions for a page
of a book. It is obvious that a narrow (“<em class="italic">upright</em>”)
book is easier to handle and more pleasant in appearance
(when open) than an album or “<em class="italic">oblong</em>” shape
of book (<em class="italic">b</em> and <em class="italic">c</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig70">70</a>).</p>

<h4>THE WIDTHS OF THE MARGINS</h4>

<p>Margins are necessary in order to isolate and
frame a text: thus they contribute to its legibility
and beauty. It is better that they be wide rather
than narrow (see p. <a href="#p106">106</a>, &#38; <span class="smcap">Note</span>, p.
<a href="#p265">265</a>); but
<em class="italic">excessively</em> wide margins are often neither convenient
nor pleasing (see p.
<a href="#p222">222</a>).</p>

<p>The “page” or column of text should be in
such proportion to the page of the book, and be
placed on it in such a way as to leave adequate
<span class="xxpn" id="p104"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p104]</a></span>
margins on every side. A narrow column of text
is generally best, for short lines are easiest to write
and to read, and do not tire the hand, <em class="italic">or the eye</em>, in
passing from one line to the next. For this reason
the text is often divided into two or more columns
when the page is wide, or the writing is very small
<em class="italic">in comparison</em>.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 70.</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The exact proportion of margin to text in a given page depends
on circumstances, and is largely a matter of taste (ex. fig. <a
href="#fig71">71</a> &#38; note 2, <em class="italic">b</em>,
p. <a href="#p256">256</a>). But just as it is advantageous
generally to keep to certain <span class="xxpn" id="p106"><a
class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p106]</a></span>
sizes of pages, it is well to keep to certain—<em
class="italic">corresponding</em>—sizes of margins for regular
use.</p>

class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch. Top margin approximately
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">7</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
inch (<em class="italic">measured to the top of the writing on the first
line&#8212;see also fig.</em> <a href="#fig65">65</a>).</p>
</div></div>

<p><em class="italic">The proportions of the margins to each other</em> follow
a sort of tradition (see fig.
<a href="#fig70">70</a>), the foot margin (4)
usually being twice as wide as that at the top (2),
the side margins generally greater than the top and
less than the foot. The two pages of an <em class="italic">opening</em>
may be viewed as one sheet having two columns of
text; and the two inner margins, which combine
to form an interspace, are therefore made narrow
(about
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> each), so that together they are about
equal to one side margin (fig.
<a href="#fig70">70</a>). These proportions
<span class="mixfract">(1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>&#8201;:&#8201;2&#8201;:&#8201;3&#8201;:&#8201;4)
approximate to the proportions common in early MSS.</p>

<p>Sufficient and proportional margins add greatly
to the usefulness and beauty of a book. That the
writers and illuminators used them when books
were read and valued in a way we can scarcely
realise now, shows that such things are not, as
some might suppose, a matter of affectation. Besides
the natural fitness of the common proportions
commends them: a deep foot margin is a foundation
to the whole, and gives a spare piece for the
reader to
hold,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> and wide side margins rest the eyes
and keep the text from “<em class="italic">running off the page</em>” at
the end of each line; and (the <em class="italic">two</em>) narrow inner
margins combine to separate the pages sufficiently,
but not too far, so that they form two “columns”
together, <em class="italic">framed</em> by the outer margins of the open
book.</p>

<p>When books are meant to be bound, from
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">16</span></span>
inch
to
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
inch extra margin should be allowed <em class="italic">all round</em>
the page for the cutting down and binding. The
<span class="xxpn" id="p107"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p107]</a></span>
binding is apt to encroach on the inner margins,
especially in vellum books, which do not open
fully; in order, therefore, that the inner margins
may keep their proper width, an extra width of
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
to
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
inch (according to the stiffness of the material)
is allowed.</p>

<h4>THE SIZE OF THE WRITING, &#38;C.</h4>

<p>The shape, size, and margins of the page (already
settled) together determine the length of the <em class="italic">writing-line</em>
(see fig.
<a href="#fig71">71</a>); and the <em class="italic">size of the writing</em> should
be such as will allow a reasonable number of words
to that
line.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<p>Eight or nine words to the line is a common
proportion in ordinary printed books, and may be
taken by the scribe as his ordinary <em class="italic">maximum</em>.
Lines having very many words are difficult to
read.</p>

<p>On the other hand, lines of only two or three
words each are generally tiresome, though they
may be allowed in special cases of <em class="italic">fine writing</em> (see
p.
<a href="#p262">262</a>), where it is less necessary to economise space
or time, and the effect of an even mass is not
desired. But in any case where there is an attempt
to make the right-hand edge of the text approximately
even, at least four or five words to the line
are necessary; the scribe may therefore take four
words per line as his ordinary <em class="italic">minimum</em>.</p>

<p>We may say generally, then, that <em class="italic">an ordinary
manuscript book should contain between four and eight
words (or between 25 and 50 letter-spaces) to the line</em>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p108"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p108]</a></span></p>

<p>The exact size of the writing allowed in a given
case may be found by a process of guess and trial,
but this is seldom necessary for the practical scribe
who uses regular sizes for regular occasions.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The line spacing.</em>—The size of the letter determines
approximately the distance apart of the
writing-lines (see pp. <a href="#p079">79</a>,
<a href="#p327">327</a>). Much depends on
whether the <em class="italic">ascending</em> and <em class="italic">descending</em> letters are long
or short (see fig.
<a href="#fig154">154</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">The number of writing-lines to the page</em> equals the
number of times that the <em class="italic">line-space</em> is contained in
the <em class="italic">text-column</em> (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> the height of the page less the
top and foot margins)—allowing for the top line
not requiring a full space (see fig.
<a href="#fig71">71</a>). Any fractional
space left over may be added to the foot
margin, or, if nearly equal to one line-space, a little
may be taken from the margins to complete it.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Large Capitals</em> are commonly <em class="italic">one</em>, <em class="italic">two</em>, or
<em class="italic">more</em> of the line-spaces in height (fig.
<a href="#fig71">71</a>, &#38; p.
<a href="#p128">128</a>).</p>

<h4>RULING</h4>

<p>Having folded and cut the large sheet of paper
into small (book) sheets of the size determined on,
take one of these as a pattern and rule it throughout
as if it were to be
used in the book.</p>

<div class="figleft isize4" id="fig72">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 72.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>The ruling stylus has
a blunt point, which indents
the paper, but does
not scratch it. A stout
pin bent to a claw shape
and held in a piece of
wood does very well
(fig.
<a href="#fig72">72</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p109"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p109]</a></span></p>

<p>Under the writing paper there should be a “pad”
of ordinary paper (or blotting paper).</p>

<p>The marginal lines are ruled from head to foot
of each leaf (<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig73">73</a>). Besides being a guide for
the writing, they give an appearance of straightness
and strength to the written
page.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>The writing lines are ruled across, between the
marginal lines, their places
having been indicated by
equidistant dots (<em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig73">73</a>).</p>

<div class="tabledisplay">

<div class="tablerow">

<h4>MS. BOOKS—GENERAL REMARKS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Sections</em> (p.
<a href="#p102">102</a>).—A <em class="italic">section</em>, or “<em class="italic">gathering</em>,” commonly
consists of four book-sheets, folded in half
into eight leaves (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> sixteen <em class="italic">pages</em>), but <em class="italic">three</em> or
even <em class="italic">two</em> sheets are sufficient when they are extra
thick, and <em class="italic">five</em> or <em class="italic">six</em> may be used when extra
thin. Parchment sheets should have their smooth
sides so placed together that each “opening” of the
book has both its pages rough or both smooth and
the pages are <em class="italic">pounced</em> after they are ruled (see p.
<a href="#p174">174</a>).</p>

<p>Before the writing is begun the pages of the
section are numbered on the inner marginal line,
<span class="xxpn" id="p111"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p111]</a></span>
about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
inch or so below the footline. This will
prevent mistakes.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Fly-leaves.</em>—One or more leaves of the first and
last sections in a book are left blank (besides the
extra sheet or section (p.
<a href="#p346">346</a>) which is used in
the binding—attached to the cover). A book of
any size or importance ought to have at least
three fly-leaves at the beginning, and three or
four at the end. These extra leaves protect
the manuscript, and, in a sense, constitute <em class="italic">margins</em>
for the whole body of the text. They
may also be used to make thin books thicker,
for the sake of the binding. At the end of
Service books, or other books likely to be of permanent
interest, additional fly-leaves should be provided
for notes and annotations (see pp. <a href="#p344">344</a>, <a
href="#p346">346</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Rough or Smooth Edges.</em>—The rough “<em class="italic">Deckle</em>”
edges of hand-made paper are inconvenient in a
book of any thickness, and should be trimmed off
after folding, though they may be left in the case
of very thin books. The deckle edge should not
occur at the top of the page, as it would there be
a trap for dust, and because it is important that
the tops of pages should all be level. The top
edge or head of a book is often cut and gilt in
order to keep out the dust—this is called “<em class="italic">Library
gilt</em>.” It is more suitable, however, that <em class="italic">all</em> the
edges be gilt.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Top Margins</em> throughout the book are kept
quite level. Any irregularity at the top of a page
catches the eye at once, while slight differences
at the side, or considerable differences at the foot,
may occur without spoiling the appearance of the
margins. All measurements for marginal and
writing lines, &#38;c., are therefore made from the
<span class="xxpn" id="p112"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p112]</a></span>
<em class="italic">fold</em> of the book-sheet and from the top edge,
which is cut at right angles to the fold.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Regular Writing.</em>—In writing one page it is a
good plan to have its fellow page, or a similarly
written one, fixed on the desk beside it as a pattern.
This will save the beginner from a very common
error—writing larger or smaller (which of course
spoils the look of the pages).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Initial Page.</em>—The text of a book commonly
begins on a <em class="italic">recto</em>, or right hand, page (see p.
<a href="#p365">365</a>).</p>

<h4>DEVELOPMENT OF VERSALS</h4>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 78.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p class="first">The earliest books consisted of a number of lines
of continuous writing in capital letters. There
were seldom any divisions of the text—into paragraphs,
chapters, or the like—or even of one word
from another; nor were important words distinguished
by larger initials. The first division of
paragraphs was made by a slight break in the text
and a mark; later, the first letter of the first complete
line of the new paragraph was placed in the
margin and written larger. When “small-letters”
were evolved, capitals ceased to be used for the body
of the text, and became distinguishing letters for
headings and important words.
<span class="xxpn" id="p113"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p113]</a></span></p>

<p>The capitals written at the beginnings of books, chapters, and
paragraphs grew larger and more ornamental, and at length were
made in colour and decorated with pen flourishes. Such letters,
used to mark the beginnings of verses, paragraphs, &#38;c.,
were called “Versals.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#footnote_23"
class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 79.</a></span>
(<em class="italic">13th century</em>).</div>
</div>

<p>In modern printing and ordinary
writing the first line of a paragraph is generally <em
class="italic">indented</em> (<em class="italic">a</em>,
fig. <a href="#fig78">78</a>), but the earlier method of
employing a special mark or letter (<em class="italic">b</em>
or <em class="italic">c</em>) is more effective, and
it might very well be used, even in modern printed
books, for fine editions. Affording a legitimate opening
for illumination and book-ornament, it was (and <em
class="italic">is</em>) the natural method for the penman,
who, starting with these useful capitals, by flourishing
them—in their <span class="xxpn" id="p114"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p114]</a></span> own colour, or by dotting,
outlining, or ornamenting them, with a contrasting colour (see
fig. <a href="#fig79">79</a>, from an old MS.), evolved the <em
class="italic">Illuminated Initial</em>.</p>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Types of Versal Letters</em> (examples: Plates
<a href="#plate09">IX.</a>, <a href="#plate10">X.</a>,

<a href="#fig166">166</a>, <a href="#fig189">189</a>).—The earlier Versals had very simple and beautiful pen shapes,
and are the best models for the modern penman to follow. After the
fourteenth century they were often fattened and vulgarised and
overdone with ornament. In this way they not only lost their typical
forms; but their “essential forms”—as letters derived from the Roman
Alphabet—became much disguised and confounded (see fig.
<a href="#fig128">128</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Versal Letters</em> are properly <em class="italic">built-up</em> (p.
<a href="#p291">291</a>) with
true pen-strokes (<em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig81">81</a>). Drawn or painted,
they acquire a different character (p.
<a href="#p292">292</a>). Their
office being to mark important parts of the text,
they are generally distinguished by colour and
freedom of form—tending to curves and flourishes.</p>

<p>The pen has an extra long slit
<span class="nowrap">(<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span>
inch to
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
inch),
and the <em class="italic">writing-board</em> may be lowered (see fig.
<a href="#fig46">46</a>, <em class="italic">b</em>)
to permit of the thick, liquid colour running out
freely. The nib is of the ordinary shape (but
not too oblique), and generally rather less in width
than the nib used for the accompanying text (<em class="italic">a</em>,
fig.
<a href="#fig81">81</a>).</p>

<p>The outlining strokes are quickly written and
immediately filled in, each letter being loaded well
with the colour, which thereafter dries evenly,
with a slightly raised “flat” surface. The liquid
colour should be fairly thick (see <em class="italic">colour</em>, p.
<a href="#p176">176</a>).</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Gothic lettering</em>” is a term used for “Black-letter”
and related types, as distinguished from
“Roman” types. “Gothic” capitals tend to
roundness, the small-letters to angularity, but in
each the abrupt change from thick to thin strokes,
and the resulting contrast of stroke, are characteristics—the
result of pen
work.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> In Versals this
contrast is marked; <em class="italic">the ends of the thinner strokes
spread</em> (see <em class="italic">Addenda</em>, p. <a href="#pxxv">25</a>, &#38; cross-bar of <em class="bold">A</em>, fig.

<em class="italic">and the heavy parts are crossed by thin serifs</em>. Versals
may retain their pen character and yet approach

the “Roman Letter” (p.
<a href="#p294">294</a>), or be changed into
the ornate “Lombardic” (p.
<a href="#fig01">34</a>). They are
capable of great variety, and the “round” or
“square” <em class="bold">D</em>, <em class="bold">E</em>, <em class="bold">H</em>, <em class="bold">M</em>, and <em class="bold">W</em>

either side. When they are very tall the mid part may be quite
straight, imperceptibly curving out towards the ends (<em

gives an effect of curvature throughout the length, while
keeping the letter graceful and straight. The head of a stem
(especially of an <em class="italic">ascender</em>) should be
slightly wider than the foot (fig. <a href="#fig83">83</a>). <em
class="italic">This applies generally to every sort of built-up
capitals.</em></p>

<p><em class="italic">The Bows or Curves of Versals</em> (and of <em class="italic">built-up</em>

<a href="#fig85">85</a>). This preserves
<span class="xxpn" id="p122"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p122]</a></span>
the continuity of the interior curve, together
with the clean contrast of the thick and thin strokes
(see <em class="italic">inside shapes</em>, p.
<a href="#p253">253</a>). The normal form may be
flattened or curved a little (<em class="italic">b</em>), but <em class="italic">exaggeration</em> in

<h4>SPACING &#38; ARRANGEMENT OF VERSALS</h4>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(Allowing for the special treatment of Versals called for by
the extreme freedom and elasticity of their pen forms, the following
remarks apply <em class="italic">generally to the spacing and arrangement of
coloured capitals in written pages</em>)</p></div>

<p><em class="italic">Versals accompanying Small Text</em> are generally
<em class="italic">dropped</em> below the writing-line, so that their tops
are level with the tops of the small letters (fig.
<a href="#fig86">86</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Sizes of Versals.</em>—Letters which are of the same
importance—<em class="italic">i.e.</em> serve the same purpose—are
usually of like size and form throughout; and
the more important a letter, the more it tends to be
elaborated and decorated (see figs.
<a href="#fig90">90</a>, <a href="#fig92">92</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Special words in Text marked by Versals.</em>—Where
coloured capitals are used throughout the text (fig.
<a href="#fig92">92</a>), the colours are usually varied (pp.
<a href="#p134">134</a>, <a href="#p185">185</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p123"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p123]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Line beginnings marked by Versals.</em>—Where every
line on a page begins with a coloured capital, the
majority of the forms are kept rather plain (see (5)
p.
<a href="#p136">136</a>). They may be effectively treated as a <em class="italic">band</em>
of simple or variegated colour (p.
<a href="#p136">136</a>). This is a
common treatment for a list of names or a poem;
sometimes, especially if there are many lines, <em class="italic">simple-written</em>
capitals (p.
<a href="#p297">297</a>) may be used instead of
Versals.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Verses or Paragraphs</em> may be marked by Versals
<em class="italic">set in the text</em> (<em class="italic">a</em>), or <em class="italic">part in margin, part in text</em> (<em class="italic">b</em>),
or <em class="italic">wholly in the margin</em> (<em class="italic">c</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig86">86</a>). The marginal
capital is the simplest, and it has the advantage
of leaving the page of text entire; it may, however,
sometimes be desirable <em class="italic">to break the continuity</em>
by an inset capital, especially in cases of closely
written text, or of <em class="italic">stanzas not spaced apart</em> (see
p.
<a href="#p138">138</a>).</p>

<p>The first word of a paragraph, which is begun
with a Versal, is often completed in <em class="italic">simple-written</em>
capitals of the same colour as the text
(<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig86">86</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Various ways of marking Paragraphs.</em>—(<em class="italic">a</em>) The
paragraph marks
<img class="letter5" src="images/i140c2.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="paragraph mark" />,
<span class="fsize5">¶</span>, preferably coloured, may
be used instead of (or even <em class="italic">with</em>) Versals (<em class="italic">comp.</em>
fig.
<a href="#fig95">95</a>); (<em class="italic">b</em>) by one word or line (or several words
or lines) of <em class="italic">simple-written</em> (or built-up) capitals in
black or colour (see fig.
<a href="#fig93">93</a>); (<em class="italic">c</em>) by some suitable
<em class="italic">ornament</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig87">87</a>); (<em class="italic">d</em>) in many cases it is
well to have spaces between the paragraphs or
verses (see p.
<a href="#p138">138</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Line-Finishings at the ends of Verses, &#38;c.</em>
(pp. <a href="#p205">205</a>, <a
href="#p425">425</a>), <em class="italic">may be made with the Versal pens
and colours.</em>

<p><em class="italic">To mark Chapters</em> (or even Books), extra large
Versals (fig.
<a href="#fig88">88</a>) may be used, in lieu of more elaborate
initials. Smaller Versals may be grouped round
about, beside or inside initials (p.
<a href="#p208">208</a> &#38; fig.
<a href="#fig92">92</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Headings and Pages in Capitals</em> (see also pp. <a href="#p128">128</a>,
<a href="#p132">132</a>).—Each line of capitals is generally kept uniform
throughout its
length,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> though different lines
vary in size and colour (see fig.
<a href="#fig89">89</a>). If it be
possible it is well to keep the individual word entire
<span class="xxpn" id="p126"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p126]</a></span>
and to let the heading or page contain the complete
<em class="italic">initial phrase or sentence</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig91">91</a>).</p>

<p>Generally the greater the number of capitals the
<em class="italic">plainer</em> their forms are kept, and the closer their
spacing. It is best to keep to the regular method
of <em class="italic">spacing the lines of Versals one of the writing-line
spaces (or more) apart</em>—though in special cases the
Versals may be independent of the writing-lines.</p>

</div></div>

<p><em class="italic">Spacing Out.</em>—Coloured letters and ornaments are
usually put in after the plain MS. has been written.
A very little practice enables the scribe accurately
to guess the amount of space which he should leave
for the Versals, &#38;c., whether it is designed to have
several lines of them, or a single letter only on the
page. A few pencil marks may be used to settle a
doubtful point, but an elaborate sketching or setting
out in pencil spoils the freedom of the work.

<h4>RUBRICATING</h4>

<p class="first">“<em class="italic">Red, either in the form of a pigment or fluid ink, is of very
ancient and common use. It is seen on the early Egyptian
papyri; and it appears in the earliest extant vellum MSS.,
either in titles or the first lines of columns or chapters.
The Greek term was μελάνιον κόκκινον; Latin</em>
minium,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
rubrica.”—(Thompson’s “G. &#38; L. Palæography,” p.
<a href="#p051">51</a>.)</p>

<p><em class="italic">Rubricating</em>, or the adding of Red, <em class="italic">or other coloured</em>,
letters, line-finishings, or signs, to a MS. or Book,
in which the main body of the text is already
completed in black, constitutes in itself a very useful
and effective form of decoration. It is, moreover,
a connecting link between plain writing and illumination
proper; and we may safely assume that the
artists who made the beautiful illuminations of the
Middle Ages were trained as <em class="italic">scribes</em> and <em class="italic">rubricators</em>.</p>

<h4>INITIAL PAGES OR TITLE PAGES</h4>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig89">89</a> represents an <em class="italic">Initial Page</em> in Red Capitals.
(The same arrangement may of course be used
<span class="xxpn" id="p128"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p128]</a></span>
with a variety of colours and with gold: see Note (4)
below). Such a page is, as it were, an “illumination”
to <em class="italic">all</em> the pages, following it in black text.</p>

<p>Title Pages came into fashion after printing was
introduced. Early MSS. commonly began with
the <em class="italic">opening words</em> written in large, decorated capitals,
the <em class="italic">title</em> sometimes being written quite small, near
the top of the page: other details were commonly
put in the <em class="italic">colophon</em> in early books (see p.
<a href="#p142">142</a>).</p>

<p>When the title is more important, in a literary
sense, than the opening sentence, it may be well
to follow the modern fashion. But when there is
a finely worded opening sentence—perhaps the
key-note to the rest of the text—while the title is
merely for reference, it seems reasonable to magnify
and illuminate the actual beginning of the book
rather than the mere name of it (see p.
<a href="#p365">365</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> (1).—In fig.
<a href="#fig89">89</a> the
title—(JESU CHRISTI) <em class="italic">Evangelium Secundum
Joannem</em>—is written in as a decoration of the initial word;
the old form “<img class="letter5" src="images/i128c1.jpg"
width="362" height="90" alt="IH[CAPITAL V WITH MACRON] XPĪ" />” is
used for “Jesu Christi” (these letters, it will be noticed, are
here employed to lighten the large capitals, see p.
<a href="#p208">208</a>).</p>

<p>(2) Where IN is an initial word, to enforce
narrow initial I, both letters may be magnified.</p>

<p>(3) The scale of the lettering corresponds with
that of the ruled lines (these do not show in the
figure): the letters and the interlinear spaces are each
one line high; the initial word is four lines high.
Such a mode of spacing is very simple and effective,
and will save the rubricator much unnecessary
trouble and fruitless planning (see <em class="italic">footnote</em>, p.
<a href="#p221">221</a>).</p>

<h4 id="p130">PREFACES &#38; NOTES IN COLOUR</h4>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig90">90</a> represents a preface, or note, written in
red.</p>

<p>It was a frequent practice in old MSS., where
there were prefaces, or prologues, or notes—not
actually part of the text—to keep these distinct by
writing them in red. A somewhat similar usage
still exists in modern typography, where such parts
are sometimes distinguished by Italic type (see p.
<a href="#p315">315</a>).</p>

<p>The distinction of a preface, “rubric,” or note
from the main body of the text makes a book more
readable, and, as a page of red (or blue) writing is
very pleasant and effective, we may certainly take
advantage of such a reasonable excuse for introducing
it. Entire books have been written in red,
but this is a questionable mode, as too much red
text would tire the eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> (1).—The writing is founded on the tenth-century
English hand given in <a href="#plate08">Plate VIII.</a></p>

<p>(2) The flourishes on <em class="bold">s</em> and <em class="bold">e</em> fill gaps at the
ends of the lines, and the spread out <em class="italic">A&#160;M&#160;E&#160;N</em>
fills the last line.</p>

<p>(3) The Headline is in simple written capitals.</p>

<p>(4) The effect of colour contrast of the built-up
Ps with the simple writing: the solid Ps (though
really the same colour) appear to be a much deeper
red than the writing, which is lightened by the intermingled
white of the paper.</p>

<p>(5) <em class="italic">Other Colour Schemes.</em>—<em

<h4 id="p132">PAGES WITH COLOURED HEADINGS</h4>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig91">91</a> represents the first page of a chapter (or
a book) with a <em class="italic">Heading</em> in red capitals.</p>

<p>It is convenient in practice clearly to distinguish
between the two modes of <span class="nowrap">beginning—</span></p>

<ul>
<li>(<em class="italic">a</em>) with an illuminated
 Initial-<em class="italic">Page</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig89">89</a>), or,</li>
<li>(<em class="italic">b</em>) with an illuminated
 <em class="italic">Heading</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig91">91</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="continue">The former may be treated as though it were a
decoration to the <em class="italic">whole</em> book. The latter is intended
more particularly to decorate <em class="italic">its own page</em>.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">Heading</em> should therefore be proportionate
to the body of the text below it. About <em class="italic">one-third</em>
Heading and two-thirds text make a good proportion.
A “Heading” occupying half, or more
than half, of the page is apt to look disproportionate,
and it would be preferable to this to have a complete,
or nearly
complete,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> <em class="italic">Page</em> of coloured capitals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> (1).—The full effect of black and red is
obtained by an arrangement of the two colours in
marked contrast.</p>

<p>(2) The lines are used as a scale for the Heading,
the red capitals and interspaces each being one
line high. If a Heading so spaced appear too close
to the first line of black writing, another line space
may be left.</p>

second line, and the square, narrow E to relieve
the crowded third line.</p>

<h4>PAGE OR COLUMN HEADING &#38; INITIAL</h4>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig92">92</a> represents the first page of a book or
chapter in two columns, beginning with a rather
ornate Heading, in which the Initial is made the
principal feature, and having coloured Versals and
<em class="italic">line-finishings</em> throughout the text.</p>

<p>It is more difficult to get a good effect in this way
than by means of a marked colour contrast (see
p. <a href="#p144">144</a>), <em class="italic">or variegated colour,
and gold</em> (see Note 7).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> (1).—The lines bounding the text would
naturally be indented, or pale (not black as in the
block), and ruled from head to foot of the page
(see Note (2) on the next figure).</p>

<p>(2) The red ornamental line-finishings (see p.
<a href="#p205">205</a>) would be more effective if variegated.</p>

<p>(3) The Versals in the text are made about a
line high, but are dropped below the line (p.
<a href="#p122">122</a>).</p>

<p>(4) The Versals in the Heading are made
one line high, with one-line spacing—between O
and D increased to two lines (partly filled by a
flourish from the D), in order to fit the U, O, and D
in evenly beside the Initial.</p>

<p>(5) The Initial Q should project slightly up and
out—beyond the bounding lines—to mark the top,
left corner more strongly (see <em class="italic">footnote</em>, p.

<h4>VERSALS IN COLUMN OR MARGINAL BANDS</h4>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig93">93</a> represents two columns of black text,
consisting of short verses, &#38;c., which are marked
by coloured capitals—forming bands of colour—in
the margins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> (1).—The coloured capitals in the figure
are made rather larger than usual, to enforce the
effect of the two lines of red and mark their contrast
with the columns of black text. In practice,
however, they would be better and more distinct
if rather smaller.</p>

<p>(2) The lines bounding the text would naturally
be faint, or <em class="italic">grooved</em> (p.
<a href="#p343">343</a>); but, ruled from
head to foot of the page, they would be sufficiently
apparent to add materially to the general
effect of orderly arrangement. (Lines are printed
here to show clearly the way the two columns are
ruled and to <em class="italic">suggest</em> this effect, though the process
block necessarily gives a false impression in making
them appear too short and too heavy).</p>

<p>(3) Extra width between the columns (and also in
the margin) may be allowed for the coloured capitals
(compare fig.
<a href="#fig92">92</a>).</p>

<p>(4) Words in simple written capitals are used to
mark slight divisions, or changes of sense, in the
text.</p>

<p>(5) A stiff Versal of a rather “Roman” type is
used, partly because of the number of the capitals
(see p.

<h4>STANZAS OR VERSES MARKED BY VERSALS</h4>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig94">94</a> represents a poem in two verses which
are distinguished by interspaces and by coloured
capitals—a brief introductory line also being in
colour. (It is supposed that the poem occurs
in a book—mainly in prose—written in Roman
small-letters.)</p>

<p>It is generally best to distinguish the verses of
poems by one-line interspaces. When this is done,
coloured initials are not so necessary, and their
value become chiefly decorative (see 123).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note</span> (1).—The writing is founded on “Italic”
(see <a href="#plate21">Plate XXI.</a>), and (it is supposed that) it would
be used here wherever the songs occurred; firstly,
to distinguish them from the rest of the text, and
secondly, to keep the lines of the poem entire—<em class="italic">Italics
occupying less room than ordinary, round Small-Letters</em>
(see p.
<a href="#p315">315</a>).</p>

<p>(2) The story opens with the first line, which
may in this case be regarded either as a <em class="italic">Title</em> or as
a prefatory note in red.</p>

<p>(3) The two red capitals are made of a rather
“Roman” type to match the Italic (and the small
Roman text of the book). The difference in
height made between the W and the S is intended
to balance the difference in width, and to give
them an appearance of equal weight. This may
be permitted where there are only a few capitals;
where there are many, their heights are generally
kept more uniform.</p>

<p>(4) <em class="italic">Another Colour Scheme.</em>—W and S would look
better in burnished gold.

<h4>MUSIC WITH RED STAVES</h4>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig95">95</a> is a reproduction, in facsimile, showing quarter of a
page of a folio Service Book (probably French, early sixteenth
century). The page consists of two columns of ten staves
each, and is headed <span class="nowrap"><img class="letter5"
src="images/i140c2.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="paragraph
mark" /> <em class="italic">In vigi</em> (lia), <em
class="italic">natiuitatis dnī</em>.</span> The book is printed
on vellum in red and black; the columns of music have faint red
bounding lines ruled by hand (not shown in the figure).</p>

<p>The red stave is very effective, and it was commonly
used in early MSS. and printed books.
There appears to be some doubt, however, as to
its practical value, and I have been advised that it
is not so legible as the black line stave, and also
that, in <em class="italic">Church Service Books</em> (see p.
<a href="#p345">345</a>), in order
to make an absolutely clear distinction, red should
be reserved entirely for the <em class="italic">rubrics</em>.</p>

<p>The “plain-song” chant, with its four-line stave,
has a simpler and finer appearance than the more
modern and elaborate five-lined stave and tailed
notes. The latter, however, may yet be treated
very effectively.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note 1.</span>—The mark <img
class="letter5" src="images/i140c2.jpg" width="110" height="110"

yellow. Yellow or red were often used in this way to mark
the small black capitals in printed books (p. <a href="#p428">428</a>, &#38;
<em class="italic">comp.</em> p.
<a href="#p302">302</a>). It is a questionable
method. (These blots have been removed from the figure—except,
by an oversight, in the case of <img class="letter5"
src="images/i140c3.jpg" width="110" height="110" alt="CAPITAL S"
/>).</p>

<em class="italic">colour</em> or other decorative treatment, occurs at the
end of a book, where it is the traditional right of
the penman and the printer to add a statement or
a symbolical device. The <em class="italic">Name</em> (of craftsman and
assistants), <em class="italic">Time</em>, and <em class="italic">Place</em> are commonly stated—preferably
quite simply—<em class="italic">e.g.</em> “<em class="italic">This book, written

<h4>RUBRICATING: GENERAL REMARKS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Contrast of Red and Black.</em>—The most effective
arrangement of red lettering with black text
involves a sharp contrast, and, as a rule, the concentration
of the red in a line or mass (see figs.
<a href="#fig91">91</a>, <a href="#fig93">93</a>, and <a href="#fig96">96</a>,
where the red lettering is massed at
the head, side, and foot of the black). Too many
red capitals scattered through a page lose their
effect, and appear as though they were <em class="italic">brown</em>-red
rather than bright red (see pp. <a href="#p134">134</a>, <a
href="#p185">185</a>). Printed
title-pages, &#38;c., may be seen with promiscuous lines
of black and red, in which the fine effects obtainable
by the use of bright colour is dispersed and lost;
while the same, or even a less, amount of red,
massed in one or two places in the page, would
show to great advantage.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Notes in Red in Margins.</em>—Red lettering, and
particularly small red writing, may be used freely
in the margins; being much lighter than black,
it appears there as a <em class="italic">marginal decoration</em>, not interfering
with the regular look of the page. Indeed,
red may be used more freely, and I think its decorative
effect is greater, in the form of rubrics, than in
any other simple form of ornament (see <em class="italic">Red in
Church Service Books</em> (pp. <a href="#p140">140</a>, <a
href="#p345">345</a>) and <em class="italic">Red substituted
for Italics</em> (p.
<a href="#p315">315</a>)).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Paragraph and other Marks.</em>—Various symbols,
numerals, and marks (such as

<p><em class="italic">Red Lines.</em>—Lines made to divide, or outline,
pages (“rules” or “rule borders”) should be sparingly
used, and then rather in black than in red
(see p.
<a href="#p364">364</a>). If in red, particularly between lines
of writing, these should be “ruled feint” with
diluted colour.
<span class="xxpn" id="p145"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p145]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Red for Ornaments.</em>—Red may be used pretty
freely <em class="italic">with</em> other colours (blue, green, and gold),
but by itself more sparingly.</p>

<p><em class="italic">OTHER COLOURS.</em>—The foregoing remarks
refer mainly to contrasts of black and red, but
apply, to a certain extent, to black with any bright
colour (or gold) (see “<em class="italic">Other Colour Schemes</em>” given
above, and p.

<h4>LAYING THE GROUND</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Drawing the Form.</em>—Elaborate letters or ornaments
may be drawn with a hard pencil, which will
leave slight indentations in the surface of the page
when the marks of the lead have been removed
with indiarubber. In the case of free lettering or
gold writing, however, the forms should be made
directly with the pen (see pp. <a href="#p148">148</a>, <a
href="#p164">164</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Preparing the Surface: Pouncing.</em>—The surface is
thoroughly cleaned and prepared with powdered
pumice stone, or other suitable “pounce” (see pp.
<a href="#p167">167</a>, <a
href="#p174">174</a>). This being rubbed well into the actual
part which is to take the size absorbs grease and
slightly
roughens<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> the surface. The surrounding
parts are also pounced to prevent the gold-leaf from
sticking to them later.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Composition of the Ground or Size.</em> The chief
<span class="xxpn" id="p147"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p147]</a></span>
substance in a “size” or raising preparation is
generally some kind of earthy matter, to give it
body. Other substances, having toughness and
stickiness, are used to bind the earthy matter and
prevent its breaking when the page is turned over
or bent, and also to make the size adhere to the
page and the gold-leaf stick to the size. Yellow
or red colouring matter is often added. A preservative,
such as oil of cloves—in a minute quantity—may
be present: this will permit of the size being
kept in a semi-liquid condition, in a closed jar.</p>

<p>The following recipe was given to me by Mr.
G. <span class="nowrap">Loumyer:—</span></p>

<ul>
<li>“<em class="italic">Chalk (Whiting).</em></li>
<li><em class="italic">Oxide of Iron—<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span> grain.</em></li>
<li><em class="italic">Glue (Carpenter’s)—4 grains.</em></li>
<li><em class="italic">Gum Arabic—2 grains.</em></li>
<li><em class="italic">Water—50 grains.</em></li>
</ul>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><em class="italic">Melt the gum and the glue together in the water,
then add the oxide of iron, and lastly put in enough
chalk to make the whole a rather liquid paste. Apply
to the parchment, which you have previously well
rubbed with whiting, and, when dry, apply the gold-leaf
with alcohol.</em>”</p></div>

<p><em class="italic">Mixing the Size with Water.</em>—A little of the
size, taken from the jar (see above), is put in the
saucer with a few drops of water to soak for an
hour or two. It is then rubbed down with a
finger-tip, care being taken to mix it very thoroughly
and to avoid making bubbles. The right
consistency is judged by experience—it should be
thick rather than thin.</p>

<p>It is essential that all the ingredients be present
in their right proportions, and the mixture should
be stirred every now and then. Otherwise the earthy
<span class="xxpn" id="p148"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p148]</a></span>
matter settles down, and the sticky parts, remaining
in solution above, are liable to be used up. What
is left in the saucer after use is apt to be deficient
in its sticky parts, and it is best thrown away.
Take out of the jar only what is required at the
time, and mix a fresh lot the next time.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Bubbles</em>, formed in the mixture, may be burst by a
needle, or by adding a minute drop of oil of cloves.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Methods of Laying the Size.</em>—The parchment or
paper is laid <em class="italic">flat</em> on a table; if on a slope, the size
would run down and lie unevenly. A quill pen
with a finely cut nib and an extra long slit (about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">5</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
inch) is used for laying the size. It is filled
pretty full by means of a quill or a brush; if by the
latter, special care must be taken to avoid bubbles.</p>

<p>Experiments should be made in various methods.</p>

<p>I. Perhaps the best way of laying the size, so
that it may set properly and that the burnish may
retain its brilliance, is to put on a thin coat with
a pen—in the direct manner in which coloured
Versals are made (<em class="italic">q.v.</em>)—and afterwards add two
or three thin coats, allowing each coat to dry
thoroughly. This requires considerable patience
and skill, as it takes a long time, and there is a
danger, in adding several coats, of spoiling the
form by going over the edges.</p>

<p>II. The simplest method for ordinary gold
letters is to make them with <em class="italic">one extra thick
coat</em><a id="FNanchor_29" href="#footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
of size, exactly like coloured Versals—first a natural
pen outline, and then the filling in (see fig.
<a href="#fig81">81</a>).
This requires some practice to do well, as the
thicker size is more difficult to manage than the
<span class="xxpn" id="p149"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p149]</a></span>
colour.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Very narrow parts—such as the thin
strokes—are apt to be deficient in size, and therefore,
while they are still wet, the pen—held nearly
vertical with the nib in contact with the surface of
the size—is moved slowly along it until the stroke
has received sufficient size and is properly filled
out.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig97">
<img src="images/i149.jpg" width="600" height="270" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 97.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>III. A method that may be found more convenient
for heavy forms, is to hold the pen across
the form to be gilded (which has previously been
marked on the parchment) with its nib resting on
the further outline (<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig97">97</a>). The nib being
moved along that line, by contact with the parchment
restrains the size from passing beyond it,
while allowing it to flow out freely behind and
below (<em class="italic">a</em>, 2). The opposite side is similarly treated,
and, if the form be narrow, the size as it flows
out blends with that already laid (<em class="italic">b</em>). The ends of
the form are finished in like manner (<em class="italic">c</em>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p150"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p150]</a></span></p>

<p>The angle of the pen with the parchment is less
for a wider form (<em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig98">98</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig98">
<img src="images/i150.jpg" width="600" height="327" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 98.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>As a general rule the size should stand pretty
high when wet; it shrinks in drying, and, if it forms
too thin a coat, it will neither hold the gold-leaf fast
nor burnish well. While the size is still wet it is
easy to raise it to any height desired by running
more size into the form in the manner described
above. It is well, however, not to raise the size
too high, as burnished gold too much raised looks
out of place on a page and has a heavy and vulgar
appearance (p.
<a href="#p184">184</a>). Very high raising also does not
dry so well, and when dry it is more liable to chip.</p>

<p>The work of laying the size should be carried
out as quickly as possible. If one part of the form
is left any appreciable time before the remaining
parts are sized, the first part will begin to settle
and dry, and the different layings will not blend or
lie evenly. Though the size is thick and awkward
to use at first, a little skill will coax it quickly and
evenly out of the pen, and it will all blend and dry
with an even surface.</p>

<p>When it is sized, put the work away to dry in a
<span class="xxpn" id="p151"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p151]</a></span>
drawer or safe place where it cannot be smudged
or get dusty.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Drying the Size.</em>—The average time allowed is
twenty-four hours, but it varies with the weather
and the temperature; damp weather may make a
longer time necessary, and dry weather or heat will
shorten the time. The thickness of the raising
affects the time very much; a very thin coat will
dry in an hour or two, while an extra thick coat
may take several days. Size not dry enough is too
sticky to burnish; if too dry, it is so absorbent that
it sucks up all the moisture which is breathed on
it. To ensure the gold-leaf’s sticking thoroughly,
it is safer on the whole to gild the size while it is still
slightly damp, and delay the burnishing till it is drier.</p>

<p>The time to allow and the right condition of the
size for gilding can only be accurately judged by
experience.</p>

<h4>LAYING THE GOLD-LEAF</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<em class="italic">In illuminated MSS., in order to avoid
risk of injury to the gold it may be laid last of all
(see pp. <a href="#p170">170</a>–<a href="#p171">1</a>). The inexperienced illuminator, however,
may find it better to follow the easier method of
finishing the gold before applying the colours.</em></p>

<p>The process of gold-laying must be carried out
steadily and quickly; all the necessary tools, &#38;c.,
should be ready to hand (see p.
<a href="#p145">145</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Gold-Leaf.</em>—This is sold in books of twenty-five
leaves. The ordinary leaf, about
<span class="mixfract">3<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inches
square, consisting of gold and alloy, is said to be
beaten out to less than
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">200,000</span></span>
inch in thickness. As
gold sticks readily to gold, especially when very thin
and liable to wrinkle and fold over, or to paper, red
<span class="xxpn" id="p152"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p152]</a></span>
bole or ochre is scattered between the leaves of
the ordinary book. This powder will come off on
the work and give it an ugly colour, when burnishing,
unless it is dusted off very carefully.</p>

<p>It is better to get gold “double” (or “quadruple”)
the ordinary thickness, specially prepared for fine
work such as illuminating, quite pure, and put up
in white books (without bole).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Cutting the Leaf.</em>—With the scissors, which must
be quite clean and sharp (or else the gold will stick
to them and tear), cut a whole or half leaf of gold,
together with the paper leaf on which it lies, out
of the book.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig99">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 99.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>The gold is cut on one paper (fig.
<a href="#fig99">99</a>) (not
between papers, for then it would stick and tear),
and the cut edges of the paper and the gold stick
together slightly. If the edge of the gold is anywhere
loose and apt to flap about, it and the corresponding
paper edge can be nicked together with
the scissors (fig.
<a href="#fig100">100</a>). The gold-leaf being lightly
held to the paper in this way is easily handled.</p>

<div class="figleft isize3" id="fig100">

</div>

<p>A piece of gold, about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
inch larger all round than the
form to be gilded, is cut from the leaf in the manner described
above (<em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>,
fig.
<a href="#fig100">100</a>). Except in the case of a very large form, it is not
worth trying <span class="xxpn" id="p153"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p153]</a></span> to save gold by cutting it
out in the same shape. Square, oblong, and triangular shaped
pieces are suitable for ordinary use; these are laid in a
convenient place—the edge of a book cover will do very well (fig.
<a href="#fig101">101</a>)—ready to be picked up at the right moment.</p>

<p>The burnishing slab (a flat piece of vulcanite, celluloid,
or metal) is placed under the page to give it a hard, firm
back, which will make the pushing and rubbing of the burnisher
effective.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Preparing the Size.</em>—If the size has dried rough,
it may be lightly scraped with the pen-knife—removing
as little as possible of the surface, in
which the essential <em class="italic">stickiness</em> frequently seems to
be concentrated.
<span class="xxpn" id="p154"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p154]</a></span></p>

<p>Ordinarily a form should not require trimming,
though if its edges have accidental roughnesses,
these may be trimmed a <em class="italic">little</em> with the pen-knife.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Damping the Size.</em>—The breathing tube is about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
inch (or less) in diameter, and 6 inches or more
in length; it may be made of paper or cane. One
end of the tube being lightly held between the lips,
the other is moved about over the size, which is
gently breathed upon (fig.
<a href="#fig102">102</a>). The breath condensing
on the surface of the size, moistens it and
renders it sticky. The amount of moistening required
depends on the condition of the size.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">

</div>

<p>Care has to be taken that the breath does not
condense in the tube and drop on to the work.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Laying the Gold-Leaf.</em>—Immediately that the size
has been sufficiently breathed upon, the piece of
paper with gold-leaf adhering (held ready in the right
<span class="xxpn" id="p155"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p155]</a></span>
hand) is placed upon it, gold-leaf downwards, care
being taken to place it steadily down, and not drag
it across the size (fig.
<a href="#fig103">103</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig104">
<img src="images/i155b.jpg" width="600" height="295" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 104.</a></span>
The burnisher is shown here held in the right hand — ready for the next
operation —— See Figs. <a href="#fig106">106</a> &#38;
<a href="#fig107">107</a>.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The Rubbing Paper—a convenient piece of thin
but tough paper (held ready in the left hand)—is
immediately laid above the gold-leaf paper, and is
then rubbed over firmly with the finger-tip, in
order at once to attach the leaf to the size (fig.
<a href="#fig104">104</a>). It is then quickly rubbed with the soft pencil
<span class="xxpn" id="p156"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p156]</a></span>
or chalk till the raised form underneath is indicated
on the surface of the paper (fig.
<a href="#fig105">105</a>).</p>

<p>These two operations may be combined by
having a little blue chalk either on the finger-tip
or on the upper surface of the rubbing paper.</p>

<p>Round the outline of this form the point of the
burnisher<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> is worked, pressing the gold-leaf firmly—through
both the papers—against the size, in the
angle formed by the size
and the surface of the
parchment (fig.
<a href="#fig106">106</a>).</p>

<p>The fore part of the
burnisher is then passed
rapidly all over the rubbing
paper with a firm
pressure (fig.
<a href="#fig107">107</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The rubbing paper and
the other paper are picked
off, and an experienced
eye can usually tell if the
gold is sticking properly by
a peculiar, smooth appearance
which it then has.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Several Letters or Forms</em>
which are close together
may be gilded simultaneously—with one piece of
gold-leaf—as if they were one complex form. This
saves time, but if too many forms are gilded together,
some of them are liable to be less thoroughly
and effectually treated.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Small Scattered Forms</em> (dots, &#38;c.).—For these the
gold-leaf may be cut into a sufficient number of
little pieces, which are allowed to fall (<em class="italic">gold side

<span class="xxpn" id="p157"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p157]</a></span>

</div>

<p><em class="italic">Additional Coats of Gold-Leaf.</em>—A second leaf of
gold may be laid on immediately on the top of the
first; this will ensure richness and facilitate burnishing.
Additional leaves may be laid after burnishing,
but, unless the first gilding is absolutely
clean, there is a risk of the second leaf peeling off
when re-burnished.
<span class="xxpn" id="p158"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p158]</a></span></p>

<h4>BURNISHING THE GOLD</h4>

<p><em class="italic">The Burnisher.</em>—A tooth-shaped agate burnisher
(fig.
<a href="#fig108">108</a>) is commonly used.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">point</em> is used for pushing the leaf into angles
and for burnishing angles (<em class="italic">a</em>).</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">fore-part</em> for general burnishing (<em class="italic">b</em>).</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">bend</em> for cross-burnishing and for angles (<em class="italic">c</em>).</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">side</em> for very gentle and light burnishing (<em class="italic">d</em>).</p>

<p>The burnisher is kept scrupulously clean, and to
ensure this it is frequently rubbed on a cloth.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Dusting off the Pounce.</em>—The edge of the parchment
may be tapped smartly on the desk to shake
off the pounce, and a feather or a soft handkerchief
may be used, care being taken not to brush the
pounce over the gold.
<span class="xxpn" id="p159"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p159]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Brushing off Waste Leaf.</em>—The superfluous gold
round the edge of the gilded form may be lightly
brushed off with the tip of the brush. This may
be done after or before
the burnishing—preferably
<em class="italic">after</em> (see p.
<a href="#p170">170</a>).</p>

<div class="figright isize3" id="fig108">
<img src="images/i159.jpg" width="340" height="782" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 108.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Any gold which may
have stuck to the surrounding
parchment, in
spite of the pouncing,
may be removed with
the knife or with the
hard indiarubber point,
<em class="italic">great care being taken
not to touch the gilded
size</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Burnishing the Gold.</em>—The
gold-leaf may
be burnished immediately
after laying when
the size is <em class="italic">very dry</em>,
but it is safer to wait
for a quarter of an
hour—or longer, if
the size is at all damp
(see <em class="italic">Drying</em>, p.
<a href="#p151">151</a>).</p>

<p>The slab is again put
under the work, and
the burnishing is begun
very gently and
cautiously: should the burnisher stick in the very
least, it is instantly stopped (or else the gold will
be scratched off), examined, and cleaned.</p>

<p>The first strokes of the burnisher are generally
carried all over the work, very lightly and with a
<span class="xxpn" id="p160"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p160]</a></span>
circular movement (fig.
<a href="#fig109">109</a>), till the gold begins to
<em class="italic">feel smooth</em>, and the matt surface gives place to a
dull polish.</p>

<div class="tabledisplay figc-s3">
<div class="tablecell" id="fig109">
<img src="images/i160a.jpg" width="190" height="505" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 109.</a></span></div>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 110.</a></span></div>
</div></div>

<p>As the gold gets smoother a little more pressure
is used, and the burnisher is moved in straight lines
in every direction across the gold (fig.
<a href="#fig110">110</a>). At
this point the gold should have a peculiar and agreeable
feeling of smoothness under the burnisher, an
unmistakable sign that all is going well.</p>

<p>A rapid light polish with the bend of the burnisher
across a gold stem will give a very good finish
(<em class="italic">c</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig108">108</a>).</p>

<p>Properly burnished gold in a right light is at first
as bright as a mirror, and in some lights may look
<span class="xxpn" id="p161"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p161]</a></span>
quite dark by reason of its smoothness. A piece
of white paper may be held at such an angle that
the white light from it is reflected by the gold;
this will show the quality of the burnish, and also
show up any brown spots which the leaf may have
failed to cover. It is helpful, moreover, during
the actual process of burnishing to have a reflecting
paper folded and standing beside the work (fig.
<a href="#fig111">111</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig111">
<img src="images/i161.jpg" width="600" height="473" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 111.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>At first the size under the burnished gold is not
thoroughly hardened, and great care should be taken
of it (not to breathe on nor finger the gold in any
way, nor allow it to lie about and get dusty). It is
best to put it away safely in a drawer for a week or
two.</p>

<p>After a week or fortnight, when the size has
set a little more, it may be very gently re-burnished,
and this may be done again at the end of another
<span class="xxpn" id="p162"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p162]</a></span>
fortnight. This final burnishing, when the size is
nearly hard, will give it a very lasting polish. It is
well, however, to take every care of burnished gold,
and to secure it from risk of damage as soon as may
be. Illuminated miniatures were often protected
by a piece of silk between the leaves—and this
should be done now, in the case of fine work.
That a bound volume protects the burnished gold
within it is proved by the large number of MSS. in
which the gold, laid and burnished 500 years ago,
is in perfect and brilliant preservation.</p>

<div class="xxpn" id="p164"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p164]</a></div>

<p>Both paper and parchment when much wet with
size are apt to cockle. Generally it is not possible,
or desirable (see p.
<a href="#p174">174</a>), to guard against this by
first stretching the material, but the size may be
used with less water, so that it will dry sooner. In
cases where there is a gold background it may often
be divided into small parts (to be sized at different
times) by the pattern (see p.
<a href="#p191">191</a>). For large unbroken
patches of gold several thin coats may be put
on, one after the other.</p>

<p>Some sizes have a tendency to crack: this is
difficult to guard against. But, if the cracks are
very minute—such as may be seen in many instances
in the best early MSS.—they do not
constitute a serious blemish.</p>

<p>Burnished gold is often damaged by careless
handling or insufficient protection.</p>

<h4>GOLD WRITING</h4>

<p>The page (having been ruled as for ordinary
writing) is thoroughly pounced all over.</p>

<p>The pen has an extra long slit, and the size
is made a little more fluid than usual to allow
of its flowing freely and making true pen-strokes
(p.
<a href="#p063">63</a>).</p>

<p>The desk is lowered (fig.
<a href="#fig46">46</a>, <em class="italic">b</em>), or flat, so that
the size may flow freely.</p>

<p>The nib sometimes makes only a wet down-stroke
on the parchment, but, by lightly pushing
the pen up again, the stroke will be filled by the
size which flows out from under the nib. Simple
pen-strokes in small writing hold but little, and so
ought to be filled as full of size as possible (pp. <a href="#p150">150</a>,
<a href="#p184">184</a>). They will be found to dry much more
<span class="xxpn" id="p165"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p165]</a></span>
quickly than larger forms, and may be gilded
within a few hours of writing. Half-a-dozen or
more letters are gilded together (see p.
<a href="#p156">156</a>).</p>

<h4>OTHER METHODS &#38; RECIPES FOR GILDING</h4>

<p>Gold-leaf may be cut with a “<em class="italic">gilder’s knife</em>” on
a “<em class="italic">gilder’s cushion</em>,” and picked up with a “<em class="italic">gilder’s
tip</em>.”</p>

<p>Water, white of egg, or alcohol may be used to
make the gold-leaf adhere to the size.</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Transfer gold-leaf</em>” is convenient, but the
<em class="italic">greasiness</em> of the transfer paper is apt to dim the
gilding.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Gold-leaf</em> is made in many shades, from “red”
(gold + copper) to “green” (gold + silver); though
these may be used very effectively, they are liable
to tarnish, and it is best to begin with pure gold
(see pp. <a href="#p152">152</a>, <a
href="#p169">169</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Silver-leaf</em> oxidises and turns black; platinum (a
good substitute) costs about 2s. 6d., and <em class="italic">aluminium</em>
(not so good) about 6d. per book.</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Gold Ink</em>” has been made with powdered gold:
its effect is inferior to <em class="italic">raised and burnished</em> writing.</p>

<p>The following is from “The Book of the Art
of Cennino Cennini” (written about the beginning
of the fifteenth Century): Translated by Christiana
J. Herringham, <span class="nowrap">1899:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“Chap. 157.—<em class="italic">How you must do miniature-painting
and put gold on parchment.</em></p>

<p>“First, if you would paint miniatures you must draw
with a leaden style figures, foliage, letters, or whatever
you please, on parchment, that is to say, in books:
then with a pen you must make the delicate permanent
<span class="xxpn" id="p166"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p166]</a></span>
outline of what you have designed. Then you must have
a paint that is a sort of gesso, called asiso, and it is made
in this manner; namely, a little gesso sottile [see chap.
116, below], and a little biacca [whitelead], never more
of this than equals a third part of the gesso; then take a
little candy, less than the biacca; grind these ingredients
very finely with clear water, collect them together, and
let them dry without sun. When you wish to use some
to put on gold, cut off a piece as large as you have need
of, and temper it with the white of an egg, well beaten,
as I have taught you. [<em class="italic">The froth is allowed to stand for
one night to clear itself.</em>] Temper this mixture with it; let
it dry; then take your gold, and either breathing on it or
not, as you please, you can put it on; and the gold being
laid on, take the tooth or burnishing-stone and burnish it,
but hold under the parchment a firm tablet of good wood,
very smooth. And you must know that you may write
letters with a pen and this asiso, or lay a ground of it, or
whatever you please—it is most excellent. But before
you lay the gold on it, see whether it is needful to scrape
or level it with the point of a knife, or clean it in any
way, for your brush sometimes puts more on in one place
than in another. Always beware of this.”</p>

gesso sottile. This is made from the same plaster [plaster
of Paris] as the last, but it must be well purified (purgata),
and kept moist in a large tub for at least a month;
renew the water every day until it almost rots, and is
completely slaked, and all fiery heat goes out of it, and it
becomes as soft as silk. Throw away the water, make
it into cakes, and let it dry; and this gesso is sold by the
druggists to our painters. It is used for grounding, for
gilding, for working in relief, and other fine works.”

<h4>APPENDIX: ON GILDING<br />
(<em class="italic">By Graily Hewitt</em>)</h4>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>Success with raised gilding can only be expected when
practice has rendered attention to the details of the process
automatic and there is no need to pause and think. Even
then the results must be somewhat uncertain and experimental.
For our own preparations of size are usually
unsatisfactory, and the ingredients of the best we can buy
are unknown to us. And our vellum is certainly not of
the quality we find in the old books. Some one is badly
wanted to investigate the chemistry of the one and an appropriate
preparation of the other. But we can take as
much care as our time allows, passing nothing as “good
enough” which we have not well examined, and bringing
to the business all the patience and deftness available.</p>

<p>Vellum is too stiff, or too dry, or too greasy. When
stiff, it is too thick for books; when dry, too apt to crack
or cockle; when too greasy, exasperating. And yet the
soft and rather greasy sort can be rendered more agreeable
than the rest with labour. It should be rubbed by the
flat of the hand with powdered pumice (or even fine sandpaper
on the rough side) and French chalk, especially
on its split (or rougher) side, until it is serviceable. A
few trials will teach how long to give to this. Five
minutes for one side of a lamb’s skin would not be too
much. It can then be beaten with a silk handkerchief,
but not rubbed with this until the size has been laid.
It may be rubbed cleaner between the laying of the size
and the gilding. Especially must those parts of pages be
thoroughly rubbed clean which in the book, when made
up, will lie upon and be pressed against gold letters
on the page opposite; or the pumice left behind will
scratch them. On the other hand, if the vellum has not
been thoroughly pumiced on both pages, the greasiness in
<span class="xxpn" id="p168"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p168]</a></span>
it will dim the gold in time, both from above and below;
or even make the size flake off altogether. The size
is often blamed for faults of the vellum and its want of
preparation.</p>

<p>Again size, or “raising preparation,” is too sticky or
too dry. If the former, the gold will not burnish well;
if the latter, it will burnish, but will not stick at the edges,
and will crack sooner or later. And though the essential
quality of gilding is brightness, one may be content to fail
of this rather than have letters ragged in outline or broken
on the surface.</p>

<p>The size in use should be just liquid enough to flow
evenly from the pen. More water makes it dry too brittle,
and tends to cockle the vellum also; less tends to blobbiness
and unevenness. Even when it is put on fairly an
uncomfortable groove is apt to form as it dries down the
centre of letters; but this can be either filled up as soon
as the first layer is dryish, or the sides of the groove can
be scraped (when the letter is quite dry) down to the
level of the groove itself with a sharp knife. The knife
must be sharp. As this scraping does not affect the extreme
edges the power of the size there to hold the leaf
is not impaired by it; and certainly a well-scraped surface
is extremely even and pleasant to gild. If the surface,
however, be burnished and not scraped before laying the
leaf, it will not hold the size well, and remains lumpy
also where lumps were there originally; while scraping
gets rid of these. During use the size should be kept
thoroughly mixed; and a small sable brush serves well
for this purpose, as soon as it can be used so carefully as
not to cause bubbles.</p>

<p>To know the exact time to allow between laying and
gilding one had need to be a meteorologist, so much
“depends on the weather.” Very dry and very wet
weather are equally unkind. Generally an interval of
about twenty-four hours is right; but it is better to gild
too soon than too late, provided one can be content, on
testing the naked surface of the gilded letter with a
<span class="xxpn" id="p169"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p169]</a></span>
burnisher, and noting that the glitter is reluctant to come,
to leave the burnishing for a while, and only lay the leaf,
pressing it well home to the outline of the letters. The
burnishing can then be done in a few more hours. But
if the size be too dry, the difficulty will be to make the
leaf stick to it at all. In this case the leaf adhering can
be scraped off, the size scraped down further, and another
thin coat added and gilded after a shorter interval. If
the letter be so fouled that such repairs are difficult, it
should be entirely scraped away and the size relaid altogether.
In doing this care is needed that the vellum be
not injured round the letter.</p>

<p>The best gold-leaf for ordinary work costs about
3s. for twenty-five pages. More expensive leaf, being
thicker, does not stick so well to the edges; cheaper is
too thin to burnish well. Two kinds may be used
together with good results, the finer leaf being put on
next the size, and the thicker at once on to the top of
that. The letter is then pressed and outlined as usual
through paper, and the thin leaf will be found of considerable
assistance towards the making of a clean cut
edge. Generally, however, the piling on of several
leaves is inadvisable, as bits are liable to flake away as
the letter goes on drying, leaving dim specks where they
have been. Yet if, after the outlining through the paper,
the leaf is seen to be very dull or speckled with the
colour of the size, this means that the size has been
partly pressed through the leaf; and another laid immediately
will have enough to stick to, and will burnish
well. The best result comes of one moderately thick
leaf laid and burnished at the right time as quickly as
possible. Thicker leaves need only be used for large
surfaces, where the edge can be scraped even and clean,
or where a black outline is to be added.</p>

<p>As soon as the leaf is laid, and from that point onward,
the breath must be kept from the letter with a shield (of
cardboard or tin) held in the left hand or otherwise.
Inattention to this is responsible for many failures. Not
<span class="xxpn" id="p170"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p170]</a></span>
only should the actual letters under operation be so protected,
but where a quantity are sized ready for gilding
on the page these should be protected also, as well as
any parts already finished; for breath not only moistens
but warms, and on warm size moisture condenses less
easily. If the work to be done presently is so warmed,
it will be found more difficult to deal with when its time
comes. The first work done in the day is often the best,
and for this reason, that the size for it is cool; but in
gilding this portion one almost necessarily warms that to
be done later. Two pages, where possible, should therefore
be gilded alternately, one cooling while a portion of
the other is gilded. Or thin plates of metal, or even
cardboard, may be placed about as shields to protect all
surfaces not under actual operation.</p>

<p>Superfluous gold is best removed by dusting lightly
with an old and very clean and dry silk handkerchief.
Indiarubber will certainly remove gold from the vellum,
but it will as certainly dim any part of the gilding it
touches. If the vellum was properly pounced to start
with the silk will easily remove all the leaf unstuck,
except little odds and ends, and these are safeliest taken
away with the point of a knife.</p>

<p>As the pressure of burnishing helps the leaf to stick, it
is best to wait till the letter has been burnished before
this dusting. Such spots as are visible ungilded may be
afterwards treated with a slight breath and transfer gold-leaf,
or gold dust, may be painted on them. In the
latter case the spots must be most carefully burnished,
if burnished at all, or their surroundings will be scratched.</p>

<p>When a gold letter is to be set on a coloured background,
or in the neighbourhood of colour, it is best put
on after the colour; as may be observed was the method
occasionally with the old books. If the gold is put on first,
it will certainly be dimmed by warmth and breath during
the colouring. On the other hand, if it is put on last,
great care must be taken that the gold-leaf shall not stick
to the coloured portions. Where possible, a stencil
<span class="xxpn" id="p171"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p171]</a></span>
pattern of the parts to be gilded should be cut out of
paper. This is easily made from a pencil rubbing taken
after the size is laid, the raised pattern being of course
cut out carefully a trifle larger than the outline so
obtained. The paper is then laid over all the work,
and the sized portions showing through the cuttings can
be gilded without injury to the colour.</p>

<p>All gilded work should be retained, if possible, for a
week or more, and then re-burnished. And in burnishing
generally the burnisher should not be used, even when the
size is hard, with any great force or pressure at first.
For the size in drying sets as if moulded, and this mould
cannot be squeezed about or actually crushed without
being loosened or cracked. Throughout the whole process
a gentle and vigilant alacrity is required. Success
will come easily if it means to come. It cannot be forced
to come.</p>

<p>The binder of a book with gilding in it should be
warned to press the sheets as little as possible, and to
use all his care in handling it, so as to keep moisture,
warmth, and fingering from the gold. The folding of
the sheets, when left to him, should also be done rather
differently from usual, for all gilded pages need to be
kept as flat as possible. None of the sizes in use seem
capable of resisting bending of their surfaces without
crimping or cracking. Where there is much gilding, the
book will be the better for being sewn with a
zigzag<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
through the sections, as this helps to “guard” the gilded
work. <span class="xxpn" id="p172"><a class="noform"

<p>The name “Vellum” (strictly applicable only
to calf-skin) is generally given to any moderately
good skin prepared for writing or printing on. All
the modern skins are apt to be too stiff and <em class="italic">horny</em>:
chemical action (substituted for patient handling),
followed by liberal sizing and “dressing,” is perhaps
responsible. The old skins have much more life
and character, and are commonly much softer.
Their surface is generally very smooth—not necessarily
<em class="italic">glazed</em>—often with a delicate velvety <em class="italic">nap</em>,
which forms a perfect writing surface.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Parchment</em> (sheep-skin), as supplied by law-stationers,
though rather hard, still retains the
character of a skin, and is in every way preferable
to the
Vellum<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> which is specially prepared for illuminators.
A piece of parchment about 26 inches
by 22 inches costs about 2s. 6d. Lambskin is still
better.</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Roman Vellum</em>” is a fine quality of sheep or
<span class="xxpn" id="p174"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p174]</a></span>
<em class="italic">“lamb” skin</em>, made in imitation of the Vellum used
in the Vatican.</p>

<p>The surface of a modern skin may be greatly
improved by “<em class="italic">pouncing</em>” but there seems to be a
danger of its becoming rough or porous.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Pounce.</em>—Fine <em class="italic">powdered pumice</em> (as supplied by
drysalters) is very good. It is rubbed on with the
hand (p.
<a href="#p167">167</a>), or with a pad or a piece of rag.
Law-stationers use a pounce in which the main
constituents are chalk (or “whiting”) and powdered
resin. The latter, when used before gilding, is
apt to make the gold-leaf stick to the surrounding
parchment. (<em class="italic">Before Writing</em>, see
Note 7, p. <a href="#p359">359</a>.)</p>

<p><em class="italic">Chalk</em>, “<em class="italic">Whiting</em>” “<em class="italic">French Chalk</em>,” and <em class="italic">Powdered
Cuttlefish Bone</em> might be used as substitutes for
pumice, or as ingredients in preparing a pounce.
<em class="italic">Sandarach</em> (a resin) rubbed on an erasure appears to
prevent ink spreading when the surface is written
over.</p>

<p>A skin of parchment has a smooth (whiter) side—the
original flesh side—and a rougher, yellower
side—the original hair side. The penman will find
the <em class="italic">smooth</em> side preferable for writing on (though,
of course, both sides must be used in a book: see
p.
<a href="#p110">110</a>). This side is more easily damaged, and
erasures have to be very carefully made with a
<em class="italic">sharp</em> knife, or by gentle rubbing with indiarubber.
On the rough side, erasures cause little or no damage
to the surface. A piece of rubber—or a paper
stump—dipped in pounce may be used. It is better—as
it is more straightforward—to avoid erasures
if possible, and to correct mistakes frankly, as in
ordinary writing (see p.
<a href="#p344">344</a>).</p>

<p>For ordinary purposes parchment should be cut
to the size desired, and be held on the desk by the
<span class="xxpn" id="p175"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p175]</a></span>
tape, guard, &#38;c. (see p.
<a href="#p050">50</a>). It is generally a
mistake to pin it down, or to damp and stretch it
on the drawing-board (see p.
<a href="#p356">356</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Parchment is stained a fine purple</em> with “Brazil-wood”:
this may be obtained from a “store
chemist.” Three teacups full of Brazil-wood are
stewed in about two pints of water, with two
teaspoonsful of alum (which acts as a mordant).
The colour of this liquid is brownish-red, and to
make it purple, carbonate of potash is added (<em class="italic">very
carefully</em>, or it will become too blue). The liquid
is poured into a tray, and the parchment skin is
placed in it for half a day or a couple of days. The
colour dries lighter, so it should be prepared rather
dark, and diluted if necessary: strips of parchment
should be used to test it; they are taken out and
dried at the fire.</p>

<p>The parchment skin is stretched on a frame,
the edges being caught up over little buttons or
pegs, and tied at these points with string. It is
allowed to dry slowly.</p>

<h4>COLOURS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">POWDER COLOURS</em> are the purest: they
may be mixed with gum arabic and water. Yolk
of egg and water is sometimes used as a medium
(or white of egg) (see pp. <a href="#p166">166</a>, <a
href="#p179">179</a>). It is more convenient
for the beginner to use prepared colours,
which are ready and dependable.</p>

<p><em class="italic">CAKE COLOURS</em> rank next to powder colours
for purity: they seem to need tempering with a
little gum or honey or glycerine (or egg—see
above) for use on ordinary
parchment.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Used
<span class="xxpn" id="p176"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p176]</a></span>
plain with water, they are apt to flake off when
dry.</p>

<p><em class="italic">PAN COLOURS</em> are very safe for ordinary use.</p>

<p><em class="italic">TUBE COLOURS</em> sometimes seem to have too
much glycerine; they are, however, very convenient
for preparing mixed colours in any quantity,
because of their semi-fluid condition, and
because the amount of each colour in the mixture
may be judged with considerable accuracy by the
<em class="italic">length</em> which is squeezed out of the tube
<span class="nowrap">(p.
<a href="#p178">178</a>).</span></p>

<p><em class="italic">COLOURS FOR PENWORK, &#38;c.</em>—For
simple letters or decoration it is well to use a pure</p>

<ul><li><em class="italic">RED</em>—<em class="italic">neither crimson
nor orange tinged</em>:</li>

<li><em class="italic">BLUE</em>—<em class="italic">neither greenish
nor purplish</em>:</li>

<li><em class="italic">GREEN</em>—<em class="italic">neither bluish
nor “mossy.</em>”</li></ul>

<p class="continue">A little “body colour” is generally used with <em class="italic">blues</em>
and <em class="italic">greens</em> to keep them “flat” (p.
<a href="#p118">118</a>). These
colours should be mixed as required, and be diluted
to the right consistency with water
(see p.
<a href="#p118">118</a>). Colour which has
been mixed and in use for some
time—especially if it has been
allowed to dry—is best thrown
away (see <em class="italic">mixing size</em>, p.
<a href="#p148">148</a>).</p>

<div class="figleft isize5" id="fig112">
<img src="images/i176.jpg" width="190" height="369" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 112.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>If there is much rubricating to
be done, a quantity of each colour
sufficient to last several days may
be mixed, and kept in a <em class="italic">covered</em> pot.
A little pomatum pot is convenient—the
smaller the better, as it keeps
the colour together, and does not
allow it to dry so quickly.</p>

<p>The filling-brush (a rough brush
kept for filling the pen) may rest in the pot (see
fig.
<a href="#fig112">112</a>), being given a stir round every time it is
<span class="xxpn" id="p177"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p177]</a></span>
used to prevent the settling of the heavy parts of
the colour. A drop of water is added occasionally
as the liquid evaporates and becomes too
thick.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<p><em class="italic">TINTS FEW AND CONSTANT.</em>—<em class="italic">Red</em>, <em class="italic">Blue</em>,
and <em class="italic">Green</em> (and perhaps <em class="italic">purple</em>) with <em class="italic">Gold</em>, <em class="italic">White</em>,
and <em class="italic">Black</em>, are sufficient for everything but the
most advanced type of Illumination. And it is in
every way desirable that, until he has become a
<em class="italic">Master</em> Limner, the Writer and Illuminator should
strictly limit the number of his colours (see p.
<a href="#p215">215</a>).</p>

<p>It is one of the “secrets” of good “design” to
use a limited number of <em class="italic">elements</em>—forms or colours
or materials—and to produce <em class="italic">variety</em> by skilful and
charming manipulation of these.</p>

<p>It is well to follow the early Illuminators in this
also: that these few colours be kept constant.
When you have chosen a <em class="italic">Red</em>, a <em class="italic">Blue</em>, and a <em class="italic">Green</em>—as
pure and bright as you can make them—keep
those particular tints as <em class="italic">fixed</em> colours to be used for
ordinary purposes. For <em class="italic">special purposes</em> (pp. <a href="#p182">182</a>, <a
href="#p202">202</a>)
paler tints may be made by adding white, and
varied tints may be mixed, but even when your
work has advanced so that you require a more
complex “palette,” you should stick to the principle
of <em class="italic">constant tints and modes of treatment for regular
occasions</em>: this is the secret of method.</p>

<p><em class="italic">RED.</em>—Vermilion is prepared in three forms:
“<em class="italic">Vermilion</em>,” “<em class="italic">Scarlet Vermilion</em>,” and “<em class="italic">Orange
Vermilion</em>.” For ordinary use “<em class="italic">Scarlet Vermilion</em>”
is the best (it may be tempered with a minute
quantity of white). “<em class="italic">Vermilion</em>” is not quite so
bright, and tends more to crimson, but, mixed with
<span class="xxpn" id="p178"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p178]</a></span>
“<em class="italic">Orange Vermilion</em>” it gives the “scarlet” form.
The <em class="italic">pan</em> colour is generally most convenient.</p>

<p>Where scarlet is in juxtaposition with gold, their
effect may be harmonised by having a large proportion
of blue in the neighbourhood: sometimes a
more crimson colour than vermilion may be used.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Chinese Vermilion</em> is a fine colour, but difficult
to obtain; it is even said that the genuine pigment
is reserved exclusively for the Chinese Emperor
(whose edicts are written with “The Vermilion
Pencil”).</p>

<p><em class="italic">GREEN.</em>—Verdigris is a very fine colour, closely
resembling, and possibly the same pigment as, the
green in early MSS., but I believe that it has not
been rendered permanent in modern use.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Green Oxide of Chromium</em> (<em class="italic">transparent</em>) (or “Veridian”)
is a very good permanent green. It is
rather a thin colour, and requires body, which may
be given with <em class="italic">lemon yellow</em>, or with <em class="italic">white and yellow
ochre</em>; being a rather bluish green, it is the better
for a little yellow. This (mixed) green is most
conveniently prepared from tube colours.</p>

<p><em class="italic">BLUE.</em>—<em class="italic">Ultramarine Ash</em> (whole tube about
4s.) is a very beautiful colour. It is rather pale and
transparent (and a little “slimy” to work) when
used alone. A mixture (preferably made with tube
colours) consisting of <em class="italic">Ultramarine Ash and Chinese
White and (a very little) Prussian Blue</em> makes an
extremely fine, pure blue. A similar mixture with
<em class="italic">cobalt</em> as a base makes a very good blue.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Ultramarine or Powdered Lapis Lazuli</em> (unfortunately
known as “Genuine
Ultramarine”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>) is a fine
colour; it may have a slightly purplish tint and need
<span class="xxpn" id="p179"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p179]</a></span>
tempering with green to make a pure blue (whole
cake about 18s.).</p>

<p>The Blue in common use in early MSS. (before
Ultramarine came into use) has a fine, pure colour,
and considerable <em class="italic">body</em>: it is more raised than any
other colour; it is often seen to be full of little
sparkles, as though there were powdered glass in it.
It is supposed to have been prepared from a copper
ore.</p>

<p>The following note on this blue has been given
to me by Mr. C. M. <span class="nowrap">Firth:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The blue is Native Carbonate of Copper finely
powdered and tempered with white of egg (Vermilion
is tempered with the Yolk).”</p>

<p>“The ore is of two kinds, a crystalline of a medium
hardness found in France at Chessy, and hence called
Chessylite, and a soft earthy kind which is obtained in
Hungary, and largely now from Australia. The latter is
from its ease of manipulation the best for paint making.
It should be ground dry till it is no longer gritty and is
of a sky blue (pale) colour.”</p>

<p>“The Blue in MSS. was liable to wash off, but the
oil in the Yolk prevented a similar result with the Vermilion.
The Blue is identical with the Azzuro della
magna (for d’allemaigne) of the Middle Ages. The
frequently advanced hypothesis that the blue was due to
a glass is based on the accounts of (I.) The Vestorian
blue copper ‘frit’ for enamels probably; (II.) on the
accounts in sixteenth century of the Manufacture of
Smalt, which owes its colour to a glass tinted with Cobalt.
This Azzuro is the oldest known Western blue, and was
probably employed on Egyptian walls, where it has gone
green, as also in Italian Frescoes.”</p>

<p>“The Green tint of the chemical change in the
Copper is seen in initials in books too much exposed to the
damp. These exhibit a bright green tint in places where
the colour was thinly applied.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p180"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p180]</a></span></p></div>

<p>It appears that Yolk, besides being unsuited in
colour for tempering this blue, changes it to a
greenish colour (the effect of the oil, which forms
about 30 per cent. of Yolk of Egg).</p>

<p><em class="italic">WHITE.</em>—The tube <em class="italic">Chinese
White</em><a id="FNanchor_37" href="#footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> is the
most convenient to use when tempering colours.</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">White Line or Hair Finishing</em>” (see p.
<a href="#p183">183</a>).
Various tools have been recommended for this. A
sable pencil with the outer hairs cut away, “the
smallest brush” made, and even a fine steel pen.
I am inclined to believe that some of the early
Illuminators used a fine quill—such as a crow quill,
or a goose quill scraped thin and sharply pointed.</p>

<p><em class="italic">PURPLE</em> is seldom used in simple pen-work,
lettering, &#38;c., but largely and with very fine effect
in complex illumination. A <em class="italic">reddish-purple</em> is to be
preferred. A good colour can be made from the
purple <em class="italic">stain</em> described on p. <a href="#p175">175</a>, or from Ruby
madder and a little Rose madder, with a very little
Ultramarine.</p>

<h4>SIMPLE COLOUR EFFECTS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Simple “Rubrication”</em> (see p.

<p><em class="italic">Repetition and Limitation of Simple Colours (and
Forms).</em>—The uniform treatment of a MS. necessitates
that no colour (or form) in it should be quite
singular, or even isolated if it can possibly be repeated.
If, for example, there be a Red capital on
the “Verso” page, the “<em class="italic">opening</em>” is improved by
some Red—a capital, a rubric, or even a line-finishing—on
the “Recto” page. Very often the
one piece of colour is very small, and, as it were,
an echo of the other (compare Line-finishings and
Initials, pp. <a href="#p205">205</a>, <a
href="#p193">193</a>). While it is not always
possible or desirable so to treat both pages of an
opening, yet, in the book taken as a whole, <em class="italic">every
colour used should be repeated as often as there is a
reasonable opportunity</em>. And, therefore, where the
opportunities for colour in a book are few and far
between, it is well to limit the “colours” used to
two, or even one.</p>

<p>This necessity for repetition applies to <em class="italic">simple</em>
rather than to complex “Illuminated” Forms—<em class="italic">e.g.</em>
a book need not have more than one Illuminated
Initial—but within such complex forms themselves
<span class="xxpn" id="p182"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p182]</a></span>
<em class="italic">repetition</em> is recognised as one of the first principles
of “decorative design” (see p.
<a href="#p215">215</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Proportions of Colours.</em>—In Harmonious Illumination,
Blue very commonly is the predominating
colour; but no exact proportions can be laid down,
for the combined colour effect depends so much on
the arrangement of the colours.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Effects of Neighbouring
Colours.</em><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>—When blue and
red are in juxtaposition, the blue appears bluër and
greener; the red appears brighter and more scarlet.
With Red and Green, the Red appears more crimson,
and the green, greener and bluër. A greenish
blue will appear <em class="italic">plain blue</em> beside a pure green; a
blue with a purplish tinge will appear more purple.
Experiments might profitably be made with simple
arrangements of Red, Blue, Green, Black, White,
and Gold in combinations of two or more.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Tempering Colours with White.</em>—Forms such as
flower petals, &#38;c., may be painted in Blue or Red,
paled with White, and then be shaded with the
pure colour; this gives considerable richness, and
the effect may be heightened by very careful white
line work (<em class="italic">q.v.</em>). Green leaves, &#38;c., may be made
very pale and then touched with <em class="italic">Yellow</em>—this gives
a brilliant effect.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Black Outlines.</em>—The effect of these is to make a
bright colour appear brighter and richer, to define,
and, to a certain extent, <em class="italic">harmonise</em>, neighbouring
colours and shapes, and to keep the design flat
<span class="xxpn" id="p183"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p183]</a></span> (see
p.
<a href="#p186">186</a>). For one or more of these reasons, all
coloured forms—patterns, charges, &#38;c.—in a compound
colour scheme have an outline—strong or
delicate, according to the strength or delicacy of
the work (see pp. <a href="#p188">188</a>, <a
href="#p187">187</a>, <a href="#p202">202</a>, <a href="#p221">221</a>, <a href="#p165">165</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">White Lining.</em>—A black outline is often separated
from the colour by a fine white line (see fig.
<a href="#fig129">129</a>).
White lines also are used to harmonise colours, one
or more commonly being painted (or “penned”)
upon the colours. This tends to make the colours
appear paler and lighter—brightening them if they
are dark. Care must be taken not to overdo the
white lining, or it will make the colours chalky and
cold. White is also used in groups of dots, and in
fine patterns on backgrounds (see pp. <a href="#p213">213</a>,
<a href="#p430">430</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Gold</em> is even more effective than white or black
for harmonising colours. It is commonly <em class="italic">Burnished</em>
in bars or frames (see p.
<a href="#p481">481</a>), and in spots
(pp. <a href="#p481">481</a>,
<a href="#p187">187</a>), or in large masses (p.
<a href="#p191">191</a>). <em class="italic">Matt
Gold</em> (see below).</p>

<h4>MATT GOLD</h4>

<p>Matt gold, or gold “paint”—the pure gold powder
with white of egg is best—is generally <em class="italic">painted
upon colour</em>. It was much used in old miniatures
for “hatching” and lighting landscapes, houses,
costumes, &#38;c.; and stars, rays of light, and outlines
of clouds were painted in delicate gold lines upon
the blue of the skies. Such gold lining has a very
mellowing and pleasant effect upon colour, but it
can easily be <em class="italic">overdone</em>. Matt gold may be used
besides, for letters, ornament, and patterns <em class="italic">painted
upon colour</em>. Such forms have either no outline, or
a very faint one: their effect depends upon their
lightness, and they are not made to appear <em class="italic">solid</em>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p184"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p184]</a></span></p>

<div class="figleft isize5" id="fig113">
<img src="images/i184.jpg" width="190" height="158" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 113.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A very pretty effect may be obtained in a small
and not very formal manuscript by painting into
the spaces left for the capitals little squares of red
and blue, and painting upon these the letters and
ornament—all in gold powder—very freely and
quickly. The kind of treatment
is rather crudely suggested
by fig.
<a href="#fig113">113</a>. The pleasant appearance
of the pages—as though
they were scattered over with
tiny squares of cloth of gold and
red and blue—is produced with
comparative ease, while the use
of leaf gold might entail an expenditure
of more time and pains than the book
was worth. In the finest class of manuscripts,
however, these matt gold letters would be somewhat
informal and out of place.</p>

<h4>BURNISHED GOLD</h4>

<p>Gold is always raised and burnished as bright as
possible, unless there is a special reason for using
matt gold.</p>

<p>The height to which it is raised varies, according
to the effect desired, from a considerable thickness
to the thinnest possible coat of “size.” Extremely
thin and extremely thick raising are both objectionable
(see p.
<a href="#p150">150</a>): roughly speaking, a suitable height
for any ordinary purpose is between
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">100</span></span>
and
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">32</span></span>
of
an inch.</p>

<p>The surface, in the case of large forms, is generally
made as smooth and perfect as possible, so that,
as Cennino Cennini says, the burnished gold “<em class="italic">will
appear almost dark from its own brightness</em>”; and its
<span class="xxpn" id="p185"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p185]</a></span>
brightness is only seen when the light falls on it at
a particular angle. The gilding of a manuscript,
however, is slightly flexible, and a large gilded
surface is likely to be bent, so that some part of it
is sure to catch the light.</p>

<p>Small surfaces highly burnished very often do
not show the effect of, or “tell” as, gold, unless
they catch the light by accident. It is well, therefore,
where the forms are small to have several on
the page, so that one or another will always shine
out and explain the rest. And while the proper
craftsman tries always to get the best finish which
he reasonably can, the natural, slight unevennesses
or varying planes of small gilded forms may be of
advantage to the whole effect. The pleasant effect
of such natural variations may be seen in thirteenth-century
Initials, where numbers of little gold pieces
are fitted into the backgrounds, and their changing
surfaces cause the whole to be lit up with little
sparkles of light. A parallel to this may be found
in the hand-tooling of a book-cover, which sparkles
with gold, because the binder could not press in
each piece of gold-leaf absolutely level. On the
other hand, the “deadness” of a machine-stamped
cover is largely due to the <em class="italic">dead level</em> of its gilding.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Black and Gold.</em>—One of the finest effects in
calligraphy can be obtained by the simple contrast
of gold capitals with black writing (see p.
<a href="#p299">299</a>).</p>

<p>While, as in the case of <em class="italic">black and red</em>, the
strongest effects are obtained by a marked contrast,
gold may yet be very effectively used for small
capitals throughout the black text. It does not
lose or blend its brilliance with the black of the
writing as colour is apt to do, but lights up and
illuminates the page. For this reason gold will
<span class="xxpn" id="p186"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p186]</a></span>
“help out” and make agreeable a black and colour
effect which, by itself, would have been a failure
(see p.
<a href="#p134">134</a>).</p>

<h4>BURNISHED GOLD FORMS &#38; OUTLINES</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Plain gold letters, symbols, and other detached forms,
not having backgrounds, are usually not outlined.</em> An
outline cheapens their effect, making them darker
and heavier, and, if the line be at all thick, concealing
the true form of the letter, and giving it a
clumsy appearance.</p>

<div class="figc-s2" id="fig114">
<img src="images/i186.jpg" width="450" height="317" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 114.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>It is an instructive experiment to make a gold
(or plain white) letter with a thick outline
(<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig114">114</a>), and then paint a background round
it. The effect is quite altered, and greatly improved
(<em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig114">114</a>). The outline no longer tells
as the outer line of the form, but partakes more of
the nature of the background, in which it cuts out,
as one might say, a little <em class="italic">niche</em> for the letter to
rest in.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Gold-leaf forms on coloured backgrounds</em> are
<span class="xxpn" id="p187"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p187]</a></span>
outlined—generally in black—in order that letter and
background may together form a flat design, stable
and at rest in the page.</p>

<p>The distinction between the use of gold “<em class="italic">paint</em>”
and the treatment of a leaf gold form should be
carefully observed: the <em class="italic">matt gold powder</em> lies upon
colour, and may appear to blend with it (p.
<a href="#p183">183</a>);
the <em class="italic">bright gold-leaf</em> constitutes a distinct form, which
either lies upon the surface of <em class="italic">a page</em>, or is, as it
were, <em class="italic">set in</em> a background.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Gold (leaf) Floral Ornament, &#38;c.</em>—If the stalk and
leaves are both gold: they are commonly not outlined,
unless on a background.</p>

<p>If there be a thin stalk in black or colour with
gold leaves: the leaves are outlined with the stalk-colour
(they were commonly <em class="italic">furred</em>: <em class="italic">c</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig115">115</a>).</p>

<p>If there be a <em class="italic">thick</em> coloured stalk with gold leaves:
both stalk and leaves commonly have a black outline,
the “leaves” often being treated as spots of gold
(below).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Gold Spots or Dots</em> are usually outlined and furred
with black (fig.
<a href="#fig115">115</a>). The
effect produced is of a bright
gold form on a <em class="italic">grey</em> background.</p>

<div class="figright isize4" id="fig115">
<img src="images/i187.jpg" width="250" height="294" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 115.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A simple “leaf” or detached
spot of gold has a
formless look, much as a
small <em class="italic">blot</em> of colour or ink
would have. The black
outline and the grey background-effect
seem in this
case to give form and interest
to the spot; at least they give it a place to <em class="italic">rest</em>
in—a nest to hold the small golden egg.
<span class="xxpn" id="p188"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p188]</a></span></p>

<p>Even a stalk and tendril (<em class="italic">d</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig115">115</a>) has the same
effect of giving intention and meaning to what
might otherwise be a mere blot.</p>

<p>When several spots of gold (or colour) are arranged
in a simple design, together they constitute
a simple form which does not require a background.
Thus the <em class="italic">line-finishing</em>
<img class="letter5" src="images/i188c1.jpg" width="90"
height="90" alt="THEREFORE" />
(a, fig.
<a href="#fig126">126</a>) has a formal
and intentional arrangement in itself, and therefore
need not be outlined.</p>

<h4>BACKGROUND CAPITALS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Background Capitals or Initials</em> frequently
employ burnished gold, either for the letters
or the ground. All the parts (including “solid”
patterns) are generally outlined in black, or dark
colour.</p>

<p>The commonest colours for grounds are Reds and
Blues. The grounds are frequently countercharged,
or made one colour <em class="italic">inside</em> and another <em class="italic">outside</em> the
initial (p.
<a href="#p190">190</a>). Sometimes little or no gold is used,
and many fine white lines are employed to separate
and harmonise the colours of the Initial and the
ground. It is well, however, for the beginner to
keep the letter and the ground distinct, by observing
the Herald’s maxim, and using “Metal on colour,
<em class="italic">or</em> colour on metal.”</p>

<p><em class="italic">The forms of the letters</em> vary from those of ordinary
capitals in being thicker in proportion to their
height, and frequently in having no serifs. A
very thin line or serif is apt to be lost in the
background.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig116">
<img src="images/i189.jpg" width="600" height="514" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 116.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A very good form of background initial may be
<span class="xxpn" id="p189"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p189]</a></span>
made out of the ROMAN CAPITAL (<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig116">116</a>)
by thickening all its parts; in place of the serifs,
curving out and shaping the ends of the stems (<em class="italic">b</em>, <em class="italic">d</em>)
to a sort of “<em class="italic">blunderbuss</em>” pattern (<em class="italic">g</em>).</p>

<h4>APPLYING THE BACKGROUND</h4>

<p>It is well first to make the
letter,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> and then to
<em class="italic">apply</em> the background to it (as though it were a sort
of mosaic). The background is packed tightly round
the letter, and the letter occupies the background,
<span class="xxpn" id="p190"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p190]</a></span>
so that they appear to be in the same plane (<em class="italic">a</em>,
fig.
<a href="#fig117">117</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig117">
<img src="images/i190.jpg" width="600" height="476" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 117.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Such “flatness” is secured even more certainly
and effectively by using two colours (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> red and
blue) in the background—one inside and one outside
the letter (see <a href="#plate12">Plate XII.</a>).</p>

<p>The curves of the gold letter may with advantage
slightly project, and so break the hard, square outline
of the background.</p>

<p>The letter should not have the appearance of
being “stuck on,” as it is apt to if the background
is large and empty, or if the ornament passes behind
the letter (<em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig117">117</a>).</p>

<p>In the case of letters with projecting stems or
tails: the tail may be outside the background (<em class="italic">a</em>,
<span class="xxpn" id="p191"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p191]</a></span>
fig.
<a href="#fig118">118</a>), or the background may be prolonged on
one or both sides of the tail (<em class="italic">b</em> and <em class="italic">c</em>), or the whole
“field” may be enlarged to take in the complete
letter (<em class="italic">d</em>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig118">
<img src="images/i191.jpg" width="600" height="332" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 118.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>There is no limit to the variety of shapes which
backgrounds may take—symmetrical or asymmetrical,
regular or irregular—provided they fit the
initial or the ornament (which may <em class="italic">itself</em> partially,
or entirely, bound them), are properly balanced (see
<a href="#plate12">Plate XII.</a>, and p.
<a href="#p419">419</a>), and take their right place
on the page.</p>

<h4>ORNAMENT OF BACKGROUNDS</h4>

<p>The ornament, as a rule, covers the background
evenly, and is closely packed or fitted into its place.</p>

<div class="figleft isize5" id="fig119">
<img src="images/i192a.jpg" width="190" height="330" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 119.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Gold grounds</em> are generally plain, sometimes bearing
patterns in dots. These are indented in the surface
by means of a point (p.
<a href="#p172">172</a>) which is not too sharp.
It presses the gold-leaf into tiny pits, but does not
pierce it. Gold grounds may be broken up into small
parts by coloured chequers (p.
<a href="#p215">215</a>) or floral patterns.
<span class="xxpn" id="p192"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p192]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Coloured grounds</em> are, as a rule, more or less evenly
covered with some form of
decoration in thin white or
matt gold lines, or in “solid”
patterns in various colours (see
pp. <a href="#p202">202</a>,
<a href="#fig129">212</a>). A simple and
pretty diaper pattern may be
made by diagonal lines of matt
gold, cutting up the colour into
small “lozenges,” each alternate
lozenge having a fleur-de-lis or
little cross, or other simple
ornament (fig.
<a href="#fig119">119</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s2" id="fig120">
<img src="images/i192b.jpg" width="450" height="443" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 120.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A bolder design, in a broad
white or coloured line, may
be, as it were, woven through
<em class="italic">counterfeited slits</em> in the letter (fig.
<a href="#fig120">120</a>). This helps
to preserve the general flatness of the letter,
<span class="xxpn" id="p193"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p193]</a></span>
background, and ornament, and gives additional
interest.</p>

<p>The mimic slits are made by black lines drawn
on the burnished gold of the letter. Where the
stem of the ornament comes over the gold, the size
is cut away with a pen-knife; the part hollowed out
is painted with white to cover any blemishes, and
then painted with the stem colour, and outlined.</p>

<p>A plain or pale stem may have a faint or brown
outline, and be “shaded” at the sides (with <em class="italic">greys</em>,
<em class="italic">browns</em>, or <em class="italic">yellows</em>) to give an effect of solidity; a
stem that is painted in strong colour (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> red or
blue) may have a central white line painted upon it.</p>

<p>Note that where the initials have backgrounds,
the line-finishings are commonly made with
backgrounds to match, though their treatment is
naturally much simpler (see Plates
<a href="#plate15">XV.</a>, <a href="#plate17">XVII.</a>).</p>

<h4>ILLUMINATION</h4>

<p class="first">It is convenient to give a wide meaning to the
word when we speak of an “<em class="italic">illuminated</em> manuscript,”
for the scribe works with a very free hand,
and when he wishes to decorate his pages he can
<span class="xxpn" id="p194"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p194]</a></span>
write the words themselves in red, green, or blue,
as easily as he could have written them in black.
He can take a clean pen and a new colour and
initial and “flourish” any part of the work to his
heart’s content. He may acquire the art of laying
and burnishing gold, and no possible brilliance of
effect is denied him—within the limits of his skill
as an illuminator (see also pp. <a href="#p298">298</a>–<a
href="#p299">299</a>).</p>

<p>A limited number of specially prepared printed
books can likewise be illuminated. But the greater
the number of copies, the less labour may be spent
on each one, and the more their illumination tends
to be simple “rubrication”—adding coloured
capitals, flourishes, and the like (see p.
<a href="#p127">127</a>). And,
if a large edition is to be decorated, the printer
must be content to use black, or black and red, in
woodcut or “process” work (see pp. <a href="#p365">365</a>,
<a href="#p372">372</a>).</p>

<p>Illumination proper may be defined as the
decoration by hand, in bright gold or colours, of
writing or printing.</p>

<p>There are three broad types of illumination,
which for want of better terms I distinguish as
“<em class="italic">Barbaric</em>” (or colour-work), “<em class="italic">Filigree</em>”
(or pen-work),
and “<em class="italic">Natural</em>” (or limner’s). These types
run naturally one into another, and they may be
blended or combined in every possible way, but it
is convenient to consider them and the distinctive
treatments which they involve separately.</p>

“BARBARIC, OR COLOUR-WORK, ILLUMINATION”<br />
(<em class="italic">See also pp.</em> <a href="#p203">203</a>,
<a href="#p208">208</a>, <a href="#p209">209</a>, <a href="#p215">215</a>–<a href="#p218">18</a>,
<a href="#p414">414</a>, <a href="#p421">421</a>, <a href="#p422">422</a>)<br />
</h4>

<p>This is mainly a colour treatment in which
forms seem to be regarded chiefly as vehicles for
<span class="xxpn" id="p195"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p195]</a></span>
colour. Its effect appeals to the senses, rather than
to the imagination; and such interest as the forms
have lies greatly in their skilful disposal or intricate
arrangement. Sometimes in their fantasy—where
organic forms are introduced—as the “great fish”
in the act of swallowing Jonah (in order to make
the <em class="italic">T</em> of ET), <a href="#plate12">Plate XII.</a> This type of illumination
appears to have reached its climax of
barbaric splendour in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries.</p>

<p>Though its revival nowadays might seem a little
out of keeping with the more sedate and grown-up
point of view of modern life, we cannot doubt that
it is still <em class="italic">lawful</em> to decorate our work with the
brilliance and splendour of gold and colours.
Whether it is <em class="italic">expedient</em> or not depends upon how
it is done: to justify our work, it must succeed;
it must be bright and splendid, and really gladden
our eyes. And we must really take pleasure in the
making of it, for if we do not, we can hardly
expect that it will give pleasure to others.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Simple and Complex Forms.</em>—Between <em class="italic">simple forms</em>—which
are in a sense permanent—and <em class="italic">complex
forms</em>—which are always changing—it is necessary
to make a careful distinction.</p>

<p>An <em class="italic">equilateral triangle</em> drawn by “Euclid” and
one drawn by a modern Senior Wrangler are, or
ought to be, practically the same thing. If the
ancients made an ornamental band of geometrical
forms, that is no bar to us; we also are at liberty
to make decorative bands of circles, lozenges, or
triangles.</p>

<p>The ancient Romans made a capital A—its
<em class="italic">essential form</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig142">142</a>) two strokes sloped together
and joined by a cross-bar (very like the
<span class="xxpn" id="p196"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p196]</a></span>
“<em class="italic">Pons Asinorum</em>”), it could hardly be simpler—they
used chisels and pens, which gave it its more
characteristic and finished form. If we use chisels
and pens properly we shall get a similar result—not
absolutely the same—for no two chisels or two
hands can be quite the same—but closely resembling
it and belonging to our own time as much as
to any other.</p>

<p>The essential form of the “Roman” A is a
purely abstract form, the common property of
every rational age and
country,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and its characterisation
is mainly the product of tools and materials
not peculiar to the ancient Romans.</p>

<p>But when there is any real <em class="italic">complexity</em> of form
and arrangement, or sentiment, we may reasonably
suppose that it is peculiar to its time, and that the
life and virtue of it cannot be restored.</p>

<p>It was common enough in the Middle Ages to
make an initial A of two <em class="italic">dragons</em> firmly locked
together by claws and teeth. Such forms fitted
the humour of the time, and were part of the then
natural “scheme of things.” But <em class="italic">we</em> should beware
of using such antique fantasies and “organisms”;
for medieval humour, together with its
fauna and flora, belong to the past. And our own
work is only honest when made in our own
humour, time, and place.</p>

<p>There are, however, an infinite variety of simple
abstract forms and symbols, such as circles, crosses,
squares, lozenges, triangles, and a number of
Alphabets, such as Square and Round Capitals,
<span class="xxpn" id="p197"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p197]</a></span>
Small Letters—upright and sloping—which—weeded
of archaisms—we may use freely. And
all these forms can be diversified by the tools
with which they are made, and the manner in
which the tools are used, and be glorified by the
addition of bright colours and silver and gold.
Very effective “designs” can be made with
“chequers” and diaper patterns, and with the
very letters themselves. And I have little doubt
that an excellent <em class="italic">modern</em> style of illumination is
quite feasible, in which the greatest possible richness
of colour effect is achieved together with
extreme simplicity of form.</p>

</h4>

<p>This is a type of illumination which can safely
be attempted by one who, having learnt to write,
is desirous of illuminating his writing; for it is
the direct outcome of penmanship (see p.
<a href="#p204">204</a>),
and consists mainly of pen flourishes, or semi-formal
lines and shapes which can be made with
a pen, suitably applied to the part to be decorated.
Its effect may be very charming and restful: no
colour standing out as in a positive colour scheme,
no individual form catching the eye; but the whole
having a richness of simple detail and smooth colouring
more or less intricate and agreeably <em class="italic">bewildering</em>.</p>

<p>It may be compared to the <em class="italic">tooling</em> of a book-cover,
both in the method of producing it, and in
its effect. A book-binder has a number of stamps
which bear the simplest forms and symbols, such as
<span class="xxpn" id="p198"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p198]</a></span>
little circles and “leaves” and stars and curved
lines, and with these simple <em class="italic">elements</em> he builds up a
pleasant “design,” which he tools, usually in gold-leaf,
upon the cover.</p>

<p>The scribe can vary the forms which his pen
produces, and the colours which he gives them,
with a freedom that the set form and the method
of using the binder’s tools do not allow. But
the skilled penman will find that his pen (or, at
any rate, his <em class="italic">penmanship</em>) largely determines the
forms of his freest flourishes and strokes, and that
the semi-formal nature of such ornament demands
a certain simplicity and repetition of form and
colour, which do not unduly tax his skill as a
craftsman.</p>

</div>

<p class="clearfix">Suppose, for example, that the scribe wishes to illuminate
the border of a page of writing. He may choose a limited number
of simple, pen-made forms for the elements of his design; say, a
circle, a “leaf,” and a “tendril,” and a few curved flourishes
and strokes (fig.
<a href="#fig121">121</a>), and with these cover the allotted
space evenly and agreeably. <span class="xxpn" id="p199"><a

</div>

<p>The ornament being treated as though it were a sort of floral
growth, requires a starting point or “root.” The initial letter
is the natural origin of the border ornament, the stalk of which
generally springs from the side or from one of the extremities
of the letter. The main stem and branches are first made with a
very free pen, forming a <em class="italic">skeleton pattern</em>
(fig. <a href="#fig122">122</a>).</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="clearfix"><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The numbers in the diagram
indicate the order in which the strokes were made. The <em
class="italic">main stem</em> (111) sweeps over and occupies
most of the ground; the <em class="italic">secondary</em>
stem (222) occupies the remainder; the main <em

secure. <span class="xxpn" id="p200"><a class="noform"

</div>

<p class="clearfix">Next the minor branches are added to cover the space
evenly, and then the <em class="italic">flowers</em>, <em
class="italic">fruit</em>, and <em class="italic">buds</em>—made
up of combinations of the “leaves,” circles, &#38;c.—are
more or less evenly disposed in the spaces formed by the
large, round curves at the ends of the branches (fig.

</div>

<p>The “leaves” are placed all over, wherever there is
convenient room for them (just as the leaves of a real
plant are). Then the stalks of the leaves are added, and,
lastly, the interspaces are filled with “tendrils,” which
greatly contribute to the pleasant intricacy of the design
(fig.
<a href="#fig124">124</a>). <span class="xxpn" id="p202"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p202]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot keepout">

<p><em class="italic">Colour Schemes.</em>—The safest treatment of such a “design” is
in black and gold (see p.
<a href="#p187">187</a>). The leaves, which are kept
rather flat, may be outlined <em class="italic">after</em> gilding. The flowers, &#38;c.,
may be made up in red and blue (tempered with white: see p.
<a href="#p182">182</a>). This is the colour treatment of the example, <a href="#plate17">Plate XVII.</a></p>

<p>If the leaves are green, the stem and outline may be more
delicately drawn in pale or grey-brown ink, and the green
may be a delicate pale olive or grey-green. (A strong, black
stem with bright green leaves is apt to look crude and hard.)
In such a delicate green plant border, delicate blue and red
flowers, and one or two rather flat gold “berries” (single, or in
threes) may be placed.</p>

<p>A very effective colour decoration of a much simpler type
may be made in red and green (or blue) pen-work—using the
pen and the colours with which the Versal letters and line-finishings
are made. A red flourished stem with red leaves or
tendrils, and green berries (or leaves), or a green stem with
green leaves and red berries.</p>

<p>A floral pattern may also be made in plain burnished gold—both
stem and leaves—not outlined (p.
<a href="#p187">187</a> &#38; <a href="#plate22">Plate XXII.</a>).</p></div>

<p>A more complex decoration resembling the “floral
filigree” has a “solid” stem in light or dark colour
on a dark or light ground (or on a gold ground),
as suggested in the rough diagram, fig.
<a href="#fig120">120</a>.</p>

<p>The examples of Italian fifteenth-century work
in Plates <a href="#plate18">XVIII.</a> and <a href="#plate19">XIX.</a> show a related type of
illumination, known as the “white vine pattern.”
Very carefully and beautifully drawn, it strongly

<p>This, the finest type of illumination, has very
great possibilities; and it is to be hoped that some
craftsmen, who have the necessary skill, will find
an opening for their work in this direction.
<span class="xxpn" id="p203"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p203]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#plate15">Plate XV.</a> is a thirteenth-century example of the
transition from the “barbaric” to the “natural.”
The dragon-tailed initial with its wonderful scroll-work
and “ivy-leaf” being the perfection of barbaric
form, carrying brilliant colour and serving to
support and frame the delicate and beautiful drawing
which it
contains.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> But in the drawing itself
the skill of a fine illuminator combines with the
fancy of a cunning draughtsman to satisfy an
æsthetic taste and appeal to the imagination.</p>

<p><a href="#plate16">Plate XVI.</a> shows a rare, and singularly beautiful,
treatment of an Italian fourteenth-century MS.
decorated with plant and insect forms (p.
<a href="#p427">427</a>).</p>

<p><a href="#plate23">Plate XXIII.</a> (<em class="italic">modern</em>) show a border of wild roses
and climbing plants: the colour treatment in the
original is very brilliant (see p.
<a href="#p486">486</a>).</p>

<p>The “natural” type depends very much on the
beauty and interest of its form; and a draughtsman
before he had become an illuminator, might be content
to decorate MSS. and printed books with pen
drawings only faintly coloured or tinted; but when
he had mastered the limitations which the craft
would impose on his drawing for pure and bright
colour, there is no degree of brilliance, even unto
“barbaric splendour,” which he might not lay
upon his trained and delicate forms.

The Development of Illumination — Line-Finishings — Initial
Letters — Borders &#38; Backgrounds.</span></h3>

<h4>THE DEVELOPMENT OF ILLUMINATION</h4>

<p class="first">An art or craft is so largely dependent on the tools
and materials which are used by the craftsman, that
we may reasonably say that it begins with the tools
and materials, through which it has been produced.
Now, “illumination” can be traced back step by
step to simple penmanship. And its true development
is most graphically sketched by Ruskin (“Lectures
on Art,” No. V.) when he <span class="nowrap">says—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<em class="italic">The pen&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. is not only the great instrument for the
finest sketching, but its right use is the foundation of the art
of illumination.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. Perfect illumination is only writing
made lovely;&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. But to make writing itself beautiful—to
make the sweep of the pen lovely—is the true art of illumination;</em>”
And also that those who have acquired “<em class="italic">a habit
of deliberate, legible and lovely penmanship in their daily use
of the pen,&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. may next discipline their hands into the
control of lines of any length, and, finally, add the beauty
of colour and form to the flowing of these perfect lines.</em>”
<span class="xxpn" id="p205"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p205]</a></span></p></div>

<h4>LINE-FINISHINGS</h4>

<p>Line-finishings are used to preserve the evenness
of the text when lines of writing fall short. When
the space left is small, or occurs <em class="italic">in the middle of a sentence</em>,
a quick stroke of the pen—often a continuation
of the last letter, or springing from it—is
sufficient (fig.
<a href="#fig125">125</a>); but where there are many and
long gaps (as, for example, in a psalter at the ends
of the verses), they may be filled in with dots (see
<a href="#plate08">Plate VIII.</a>) or flourishes (<em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>, <em class="italic">c</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig126">126</a>) either
made in black with the script pen, or with another
pen, in colour or gold.</p>

<p>Line-finishings commonly echo the treatment of
the initials (see p.
<a href="#p181">181</a>). In twelfth-century MSS.
long delicate flourishes are commonly found, in red,
blue, or green—matching the colours of the Versals,
and probably <em class="italic">made with the same pen</em>. The latter
being rather finer than the text pen keeps these
flourishes from appearing too prominent (see <em class="italic">e</em>, <em class="italic">f</em>,
fig.
<a href="#fig126">126</a>).</p>

<p>Such work should be simple and characteristic
pen-work, showing the thicks and thins and crisp
curves, the result of the position of the pen, which
is usually “slanted” (see p.
<a href="#p043">43</a>).</p>

<p>Bands of pen-made “geometrical” patterns—used
with rather close writing—may be very simple and
direct, though appearing pleasantly elaborate (see
figs. <a href="#fig87">87</a> and (g) <a href="#fig126">126</a>,
<a href="#plate14">Plate XIV.</a>, and pp. <a href="#p215">215</a> &#38;

<em class="italic">and the Collotype Plates</em>)</h4>

<p>The development of Illumination proper was—and
still is—bound up with the growth and decoration
of the Initial Letter.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="xxpn" id="p208"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p208]</a></div>

<p>The first step in this development is the mastery
of the pen-made Versal letter, and the right treatment
of simple coloured capitals (see chapters VII.,
VIII., and X.). The next step is their elaboration.
The simplest ornamental treatment is found in the
flourishing of a terminal of the initial letter (fig.
<a href="#fig150">150</a>),
or the arrangement of the <em class="italic">remaining letters of the
word</em> inside or beside it. Pen flourishes may consist
of the simplest curved and zigzag strokes (sometimes
springing from the actual letter: see p.
<a href="#p251">251</a>), ending
with a “twirl” of the pen in a loop or a “bud”
(figs.
<a href="#fig150">150</a>, <a href="#fig79">79</a>); or they may strike out a sort of formal
floral pattern, filling or surrounding the initial (fig.
<a href="#fig92">92</a>), and such a pattern in its turn may spring
from the letter into the margin, and grow into a
complete “illuminated border” (see p.
<a href="#p199">199</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Hollow Letters.</em>—A large capital is often made
hollow, primarily with a view to lightening its appearance,
which might be rather heavy if the letter
were made solid (p.
<a href="#p119">119</a>). The hollow—which is
commonly left plain (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> the colour of the paper or
parchment)—may be a mere line, straight or curved
or zigzag (fig.
<a href="#fig189">189</a>), or a pattern, or lettering (fig.
<a href="#fig89">89</a>). Sometimes it is made large and filled in with a
contrasting colour, leaving a white line, however,
between the two colours. And sometimes half the
letter is made in one colour, and the other half (on
the opposite side of the hollow centre) is made in a
contrasting colour. A “hollow” letter (especially
if very large) may be strengthened and improved by
a filling of colour or ornament. (<em class="italic">Addenda</em>, p.
<a href="#pxxv">25</a>.)</p>

<p><em class="italic">“Woven” Forms.</em>—A simple form of ornament
(related to “Basket work”) which effectually
strengthens the construction of a hollow letter—without
impairing its lightness—consists in a crossing
<span class="xxpn" id="p209"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p209]</a></span>
and “weaving” or knotting of its actual parts
(fig.
<a href="#fig127">127</a>).</p>

<p>The elaborated
<img class="letter3" src="images/i209c1e.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="ROUND E" />
(in fig.
<a href="#fig127">127</a>) is from a 10th
or 11th century MS. (Brit. Museum, Egerton,
608). The Initial and its inwoven ornament cut
up the background into a number of distinct parts
(distinctly coloured). Note also that the entire
background is contained by the Initial.</p>

<p>The “knot” (fig.
<a href="#fig127">127</a>), or a basket-work ornament,
is sometimes used as an arbitrary starting-point
for a filigree border (see p.
<a href="#p428">428</a>) where an
initial is lacking.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Variety in Initials.</em>—The <em class="italic">sizes</em> and <em class="italic">styles</em> of the
initials which are used <em class="italic">for the same purpose</em> throughout
the book vary very slightly or not at all. Generally,
the more important the division which the
<span class="xxpn" id="p210"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p210]</a></span>
initial marks, the larger the initial and the more
ornate (p.
<a href="#p298">298</a>). A slight complexity in the opening
letter or word of a book does not seriously
interfere with the readableness of the book as a
whole. The general rule is followed that <em class="italic">the greater
the number of (decorative) forms the plainer they are kept</em>
(see p.
<a href="#p126">126</a>), and if a book contained an “initial”
on every page, it would be both an artistic and a
working economy (if there were many pages) to
make the majority of them rather plain.</p>

<p>But however simple the treatment of the initials
may be, there is still room for considerable variety
of <em class="italic">form</em> or <em class="italic">ornament</em> or <em class="italic">type</em>—as “round” or “square”
letters (see fig.
<a href="#fig80">80</a>, and especially <a href="#plate11">Plate XI.</a>). Such
variety is found in the best work; it adds a liveliness
and charm which are quite lacking where there is
unnecessary or mechanical repetition.</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Lombardic</em>” versus <em class="italic">Roman Capitals</em>.—The round,
fat letters which are known as “Lombardic” (see
fig. <a href="#fig01">1</a>, and Plates
<a href="#plate15">XV.</a>, <a href="#plate17">XVII.</a>) have been generally
used for “illuminated initials” in Northern Europe
since the thirteenth century. But—though they are
capable of very beautiful treatment—they are
rather doubtful models for us to follow. The fact
that such letters will always pack neatly into a
square niche or background—though an obvious
convenience—is not an unmixed advantage. And
the majority of examples show a debased type of
Letters—often so unlike their originals, and so like
one another, as to be scarcely readable. For the
sake of readableness the stems should be made
longer (fig.
<a href="#fig128">128</a>). The more slender “Roman”
type of initial, commonly used in Italy (<a href="#plate18">Plate
XVIII.</a>), is in every way a more legible letter.
The Roman Alphabet still remains the finest
<span class="xxpn" id="p211"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p211]</a></span>
model, and it is better that fine lettering should be
almost too slender and delicate, than that it should
be at all heavy or clumsy.</p>

<h4>BORDERS &#38; BACKGROUNDS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">The illuminated border</em> was originally an extension
or branching out of the initial decoration. It
commonly occupied the greater part of the left-hand
margin, and from thence it extended into the <em
class="italic">head</em><a id="FNanchor_45" href="#footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
or <em class="italic">foot</em> margin (or into both), or completely surrounded
the text, and even the eight margins of a
<span class="xxpn" id="p213"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p213]</a></span>
complete <em class="italic">opening</em> are sometimes covered with illumination.
In late and modern usage the border is
frequently separated from the initial, constituting a
“framing
border.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—This diagram suggests a
simple treatment of an initial word in colours and gold. The
graphic method employed by heralds for indicating these—by lines
and dots—is here discarded for the stronger contrasts of black,
white, and “grey.”</p>

<p>The letters contained inside the initial P are kept
distinct—(1) <em class="italic">crimson</em> (“grey” in diagram)
being used solely for the patches of ground adjoining the (<em

part of the (<em class="italic">gold</em>) P, the whole word
stands out in <em class="italic">crimson and gold</em>; (2) the
floral pattern is also in <em class="italic">gold</em>, but it
does not cover or hide any part of the word.</p>

<p>The remaining ground is <em class="italic">green</em> inside
and <em class="italic">blue</em> outside the P. The dots

a <em class="italic">red</em> centre dot on the blue.</p>

and the blue ground has a <em class="italic">black</em>
outline, separated from it by a <em class="italic">white</em>
line.</p></div>
</div></div><!--end caption-->

<p>In some MSS. there are <em class="italic">two</em> side-borders on a
page, one springing from the Initials on the left,
the other sending branches into the gaps on the
right (see Plates
<a href="#plate17">XVII.</a>, <a href="#plate16">XVI.</a>). In some cases the
two pages of an opening are balanced by a side-border
in each of the wide side margins (p.
<a href="#p428">428</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Backgrounds</em> of Initials (see pp. <a href="#p188">188</a>–<a
href="#p193">193</a>, <a href="#p421">421</a>–<a href="#p423">23</a>)
and borders are treated very similarly. It may be
noted that, where a <em class="italic">solid-stem</em> pattern cuts up the
ground into small pieces, these are often painted in
different colours—commonly red, and green, and blue
(see pp. <a href="#p209">209</a>,
<a href="#p430">430</a>). And the <em class="italic">groups of dots</em> (fig.
<a href="#fig129">129</a>)—in
white or other colours—may fill the interstices
of a background, putting the finishing touch to the
even covering and pleasant intricacy of the decoration
(<em class="italic">comp.</em> p.
<a href="#p201">201</a>). Or little flowers and leaves may
be used instead—growing from a thin (white) stem
which appears to twine throughout the main pattern—just
as the smaller plants in a hedge creep and
twine among the larger stems. There is no better
model in nature for the illuminator than a country
hedgerow.

</span></a><span class="h3desc">
“Design” — Elementary Patterns in Decoration — Scale
&#38; Scope of Decoration — Of “Designing” Manuscripts,
Generally.</span></h3>

<h4>“DESIGN”</h4>

<p class="first">Perhaps the nearest right definition of “design”
is “<em class="italic">contrivance</em>”—applied to the actual doing of the
work, rather than to the work when done: “<em class="italic">decoration</em>”
(when that is the sense intended) is a
safer
word,<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> because it implies “<em class="italic">of something</em>.” And
generally that “something” lies at the root of the
matter. For example: “illuminated initials” and
“illuminated borders,” so called, are really illuminat<em class="italic">ing</em>:
they are properly <em class="italic">a decoration of manuscript
or print</em>.</p>

<p>To consider a “piece-of-decoration” as a thing
existing apart from that which it decorates, as
something drawn or copied, and, so to speak, <em class="italic">stuck
on</em> to the finished work, is as <em class="italic">un</em>natural as it would
be to contemplate the flame-of-a-candle as a thing
apart from the candle.
<span class="xxpn" id="p215"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p215]</a></span></p>

<p>The finest decoration is really part of the work
itself, and may be described as <em class="italic">the finishing touches
given directly to the work by the tools which are properly
employed on it</em>.</p>

<p>The illuminator has, as a rule, to decorate a
given manuscript with pen or brush work—it may
be with the simplest pen flourishes, or with the
most elaborate figure “design.” <em class="italic">How</em> to make
that illumination part of the work, he can learn
only by patient practice and by careful handling
of his tools.</p>

<h4>ELEMENTARY PATTERNS IN DECORATION</h4>

<p>Nearly all simple Decoration consists of a comparatively
limited number of <em class="italic">elements</em>—simple forms
and pure colours—which are built up into more
complex forms to occupy an allotted space. A
primitive type of such built-up decoration is seen
in the dotted patterns, which are found in every
age—in the remains of the most ancient art, and
in the shell decorations which children make on
the sands at the present day. Examples of dotted
“backgrounds” in the “Durham Book” are shown
in fig.
<a href="#fig130">130</a> (<em class="italic">a</em> and <em class="italic">b</em>). Chequers and Diapers—in
which two or more elements are employed—are related
patterns.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> (<em class="italic">See also Addenda,
p.
<a href="#pxxv">25</a> &#38; fig. <a href="#fig191a">191a</a>.</em>)</p>

<p>A simple way of filling a band (or long narrow
<span class="xxpn" id="p216"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p216]</a></span> space) is to run a
zigzag line along it (<em class="italic">c</em>). This
may be treated either as a line or wavy stem, which may
send out buds, leaves, or flowers into the spaces (<em
class="italic">g</em>), or as two series of triangles
which may be “<em class="italic">countercharged</em>” (<em
class="italic">f</em>).<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#footnote_49"
class="fnanchor">49</a> A second zigzag, cutting the first, would
produce two series of triangles and a central row of lozenges
(<em class="italic">d</em>). And it is not a very great step from
this to the “twist” where the two lines pass over and under,
the lines being made “solid” in white or gold on a coloured
background (<em class="italic">e</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig130">130</a>). The main
difference appears to be that while the one is of the nature of
an abstract form, the other suggests a concrete form, such as
might be made with twisted cords or rods.</p>

<div class="figc-s1a" id="fig130">
<img src="images/i217.jpg" width="524" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 130.</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>These primitive patterns never become antiquated; they
are still the root forms of “design,” and the pleasant
even covering of a given space by simple elements—which
is their <em class="italic">métier</em>—accounts for much
of the unconscious pleasure which we take in good <em
class="italic">bricklaying</em> or <em class="italic">sewing</em>
or <em class="italic">writing</em>, and in a thousand things,
where “<em class="italic">many littles make a mickle</em>.”</p>

<p>For their decorative possibilities in Illumination
we can experiment in the most delightful way—framing
our writing with bands of countercharged
triangles in burnished gold, and blue and white, or
with golden zigzags on a blue ground, or chequering
backgrounds with scarlet and blue, and trying
a hundred and one other ways (p.
<a href="#p197">197</a>). Such
patterns have been made the most of in Heraldry,
<span class="xxpn" id="p218"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p218]</a></span>
an art which in itself would form a foundation for
a splendid and complete scheme of Illumination.</p>

<h4>SCALE &#38; SCOPE OF DECORATION</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Penmanship.</em>—Many of the most beautiful MSS.
were made in pen-work
throughout.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> And it is well
that the penman should stick to his pen as much
as is possible. Not only does it train his hand to
make pen ornaments, the forms of which are in
keeping with the writing, but it helps to keep the
decoration proportionate in every way. It is an
excellent plan for the beginner to use the writing-pen
for plain black capitals or flourishes, and to
make <em class="italic">all</em> other decoration with similar or slightly
finer pens than the one used for the writing.</p>

<p>Again, the direct use of the pen will prevent
much mischievous “sketching.” Sketching is right
in its proper place, and, <em class="italic">where you know exactly what
you wish to do</em>, it is useful to sketch in lightly the
main parts of a complex “design” so that each
part may receive a fair portion of the available
space. But do not spoil your MS. by experimental
pencilling in trying to find out what you want to
do. Experiments are best made roughly with a
pen or brush on a piece of paper laid on the available
space in the MS., or by colouring a piece of
paper and cutting it out to the pattern desired and
laying it on. Such means are also used to settle
small doubts which may arise in the actual
<span class="xxpn" id="p219"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p219]</a></span>
illuminating—as to whether—and where—some form or
some colour should be placed on the page.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Filigree, Floral, &#38; other Decoration.</em>—The acquired
skill of the penman leads very naturally to
a pen flourishing and decoration of his work, and
this again to many different types of filigree decoration
more or less resembling floral growths (see
figs.
<a href="#fig125">125</a>, <a href="#fig126">126</a>; pp.
<a href="#p197">197</a>–<a href="#p202">202</a>; Plates
<a href="#plate16">XI.</a>, <a href="#plate17">XVII.</a>).</p>

<p>Now all right decoration in a sense <em class="italic">arranges
itself</em>, and we may compare the right action of
the “designer’s” mind to that necessary vibration
or “directive” motion which permeates the universe
and, being communicated to the elements, enables
the various particles to fall into their right places:
as when iron filings are shaken near a magnet
they arrange themselves in the natural curves of
the magnetic field, or as a cello bow, drawn over
the edge of a sand-sprinkled plate, gathers the sand
into beautiful “musical patterns.”</p>

<p>And to most natural growths, whether of plants
or ornament, this principle of self-arrangement
seems common, that they <em class="italic">spread out evenly and
occupy to the greatest extent possible their allotted space</em>.
Branches and leaves most naturally <em class="italic">grow away from
the stem and from each other</em>, and oppose elbows and
points in every direction. In this way the
growth fits its place, looking secure and at rest—while
in disconnected parallels, or branches
following their stem, there is often insecurity and
unrest.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> (<em class="italic">See also Addenda, p.
<a href="#pxxv">25</a>.</em>)</p>

<p>For example: a circular space is filled more
<span class="xxpn" id="p220"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p220]</a></span>
decoratively by a cross (<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig131">131</a>) than by a
contained circle; a square is better filled by a
“lozenge” or a circle (<em class="italic">b</em> and <em class="italic">c</em>) than by a smaller
square set square and parallel (compare the diapering
of the chequers in fig.
<a href="#fig191a">191</a> <em class="italic">a</em>). A circular or
square space might be filled on this principle with
a filigree arrangement such as is suggested by (<em class="italic">d</em>,
fig.
<a href="#fig131">131</a>). <em class="italic">Note.</em>—In the case of two curves in the
ornament touching (either internally or externally)
they may be linked at this point by a (gold) band
or circle or lozenge (<em class="italic">e</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig131">131</a>, <em class="italic">see also</em> <a href="#plate17">Plate XVII.</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig131">
<img src="images/i220.jpg" width="600" height="491" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 131.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Miniatures and Drawing.</em>—In drawing and painting,
the difficulty which is apt to beset the illuminator
is how to strike a balance between “Naturalism”
and “Conventionalism,” so called. While
the only criterion is good taste, we may be guided
by certain general principles.</p>

<p>To limit the number of elements in a “design”—whether
of form or colour—is nearly always an
<span class="xxpn" id="p221"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p221]</a></span>
advantage (pp. <a href="#p177">177</a>,
<a href="#p181">181</a>, <a href="#p198">198</a>). And the miniaturist,
while depicting the nature of a plant, usually
<em class="italic">limits the number of its branches and leaves and shades
of colour</em>. Every part of a “design” should be
drawn clearly and distinctly, and in proportion to
the whole. The miniaturist, therefore, usually
<em class="italic">draws in careful outline every branch and leaf, making
the whole proportional with the MS. which it decorates</em>.</p>

<p>In fact, the qualities of good illumination are
the same as <em class="italic">the qualities of good writing—Simplicity,
Distinctiveness, Proportion, &#38;c.</em> (see p.
<a href="#p239">239</a>). And
the “convention” (here literally a <em class="italic">coming together</em>)
required is only such as will make the drawing and
colouring of the illumination and the form and
colour of the writing <em class="italic">go well together</em>.</p>

<h4>OF “DESIGNING” MANUSCRIPTS GENERALLY</h4>

<p>Cultivate the simplest and most direct methods,
and make “rules of
thumb”<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> for work-a-day use, to
carry you successfully through all routine or ordinary
difficulties, so that your hand will be trained
and your mind free and ready to deal with the
harder problems when they arise.
<span class="xxpn" id="p222"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p222]</a></span></p>

<p>Use a limited number of pure, bright colours,
and keep your work clean, neat, and definite.</p>

<p>Go straight ahead, trusting to workman-like
methods, and not calculating overmuch. Do the
work in a regular order, settling, first, the general
scheme, the size of the book, the writing, and the
margins; then when you are <span class="nowrap">ready—</span></p>

<p>1. Prepare the sheets (see pp. <a href="#p099">99</a>,
<a href="#p110">110</a>, <a href="#p167">167</a>).</p>

<p>2. Write the text—leaving spaces for decoration.</p>

<ul><li>3. Write in—
<ul><li>(<em class="italic">a</em>) The coloured writing.</li>
<li>(<em class="italic">b</em>) The coloured capitals.</li>
<li>(<em class="italic">c</em>) The line-finishings.</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<ul><li>4. Illuminate—Following a regular order in the various processes
<span class="nowrap">involved—</span>
<ul><li>(<em class="italic">a</em>) The Initials.</li>
<li>(<em class="italic">b</em>) Line-finishings.</li>
<li>(<em class="italic">c</em>) The Borders.</li>
</ul></li></ul>

<p>5. Bind the book (p.
<a href="#p346">346</a>), or have it bound, in order to make a
real and finished piece of work.</p>

<p>Practise an artistic economy of time and space:
usually the quicker you write the MS. the better
it is. Allow sufficient margins to make the book
readable and handsome, but not so wide as to make
it appear fanciful. Allow sufficient ornament, not
overloading the book with it. Let the ornament
be of a type suited to the book and to the subject—not
<em class="italic">too painstaking</em> or elaborate in an ordinary MS.;
not too hasty and slight in an important work.</p>

<p>Endeavour to strike a balance between what may be called
“practical” and “ornamental” considerations: an illuminated MS.
is not meant to be entirely “practical,” but it is a greater
failure if made entirely “ornamental.” Let the text be <em
class="italic">readable</em> in every sense, and let the ornament
<em class="italic">beautify</em> it: there should be give
and take, as it were, and that most desirable quality—“sweet
reasonableness.” <span class="xxpn" id="p223"><a class="noform"

“The alphabet which we use at the present day has been
traced back, in all its essential forms, to the ancient hieratic
writing of Egypt of about the twenty-fifth century before
Christ. It is directly derived from the Roman alphabet; the
Roman, from a local form of the Greek; the Greek, from the
Phœnician; the Phœnician, from the Egyptian hieratic.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
We may without exaggeration&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. carry back the invention
of Egyptian writing to six or seven thousand years before
Christ.”—<em class="italic">Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, “Greek and Latin
Palæography,”</em> <span class="nowrap">pp. 1–2.</span></p></div>

It is possible that their forms were influenced by the use of
the brush in painting up public notices and the like. The
introduction of the use of vellum—a perfect writing material—in
the making of books, led to such a great advance in the
formality and finish of the book-hands (especially of the Uncial
character) that, practically, it may be said to mark the beginning
of <em class="italic">penmanship</em> as a “fine” art. This change may be
assigned to any time between the first and the third centuries
(palæographical dates before the fifth century must generally
be regarded as approximate).</p></div>

Some Eastern scribes use a “pad” of <em class="italic">fur</em>. This, or a piece

helpful, and experiments should be made in this direction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="footnote_11" href="#FNanchor_11" class="fnlabel">11</a>
The ordinary “Reed pen” of the artists’ colourman is
rather soft and weak for formal writing. The reeds used by
the native scribes in India and Egypt, and some of the harder
English reeds, are excellent. A fine, hollow cane also makes
a very good pen.</p></div>

writing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnlabel">13</a>
If the edge of the nib were cut at right angles to the shaft,
obviously the horizontal stroke would not be thin, and the true
thick and thin strokes would be oblique (see “<em class="italic">slanted pen</em>”

The surface of horny or greasy parchment may be slightly

The modern illuminator, having no tradition for making
such scroll-work, would find that natural or organic forms—as
of trees or plants (see p.
<a href="#p221">221</a>)—would serve the same end and
have more “sweet reasonableness” in modern eyes. Excellent
scroll-work, moreover, might be formed out of ornamental
Capitals—if sufficient excuse could be found for introducing
them: a large flourished <em class="bold">L</em>, for example,
could be made exactly
on the same lines as the pendant and scroll in <a href="#plate15">Plate XV.</a>

<h4>GOOD MODELS</h4>

<p class="first">If lettering is to be rightly constructed and
arranged, the study of good models is essential.
Some of the writing and lettering in the old MSS.,
and the letters used on various old tombstones and
brasses, weeded of archaisms, will be found almost
perfect models. Yet to select one of these from
the many which are “more or less” good, requires
much discrimination.</p>

<p>It is suggested below that the essential virtues
of good lettering are <em class="italic">readableness</em>, <em class="italic">beauty</em>, and <em class="italic">character</em>.
If, then, we can discover some of the underlying
qualities which make for these, our choice
will at least be better considered, and instead of
<span class="xxpn" id="p238"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p238]</a></span>
forming our “style” on the first type of letter that
pleases, we shall found our work on a good model,
full of possibilities of development.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Roman Capital</em> (Chap. XV.).—The ancestor
of all our letters is in undisputed possession of the
first place: but it is open to comparatively few to
make a practical study of its monumental forms by
means of cutting inscriptions in stone with a chisel.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Pen-formed letters</em> are more easily practised,
and the mastery of the pen acquired in the practice
of a root form—such as the half-uncial—is the key
to the majority of alphabets (which are pen developed)
and to those principles underlying the
right construction and arrangement of lettering,
which it is our business to discover.</p>

<p>Doubtless a “school” of lettering might be
founded on any fine type, and a beautiful alphabet
or fine hand might be founded on any fine inscription:
but the practical student of penmanship may
be sure of acquiring a knowledge of lettering which
would be useful to any craftsman concerned with
letters, be he printer, book-illustrator, engraver, or
even inscription carver.</p>

<h4>THE QUALITIES OF GOOD LETTERING</h4>

<p>The first general virtue of lettering is <em
class="italic">readableness</em>, the second, <em

basis of the following summary is the assumption that
such <em class="italic">fitness</em> is comprised in <em

and that a given piece of lettering having <em

lettering.</p>

<p>The qualities on which these virtues seem chiefly to depend, and

<p>This summary, while not presuming to define
the <em class="italic">Virtues</em>, or achieve <em class="italic">Beauty</em> by a formula, does
indicate some guiding principles for the letter-maker,
and does suggest a definite meaning which
may be given to the terms “Right Form,” “Right
Arrangement,” and “Right Expression” in a
particular craft.</p>

<p>It is true that “Readableness” and “Character”
are comprised in <em class="italic">Beauty</em>, in the widest sense; but
it is useful here to distinguish them: <em class="italic">Readableness</em>
as the only sound basis for a practical theory of
lettering, and <em class="italic">Character</em> as the product of a particular
hand &#38; tool at work in a particular craft.</p>

<p>The above table, therefore, may be used as a test
of the qualities of any piece of lettering—whether
Manuscript, Printing, or Engraving—provided that
the significations of those qualities on which
“Character” depends be modified and adapted to
each particular instance. It is however a test for
general qualities only—such as may help us in
choosing a model: for as to its particular virtue
each work stands alone—judged by its merits—in
spite of all rules.</p>

<h4 title="SIMPLICITY">SIMPLICITY<br />
(<em class="italic">As having no unnecessary parts</em>)</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Essential Forms and their Characterisation.</em>—The
“Essential Forms” may be defined briefly as the
<em class="italic">necessary parts</em> (see p.
<a href="#p275">275</a>). They constitute the
skeleton or structural plan of an alphabet; and <em class="italic">One
of the finest things the letter-craftsman can do, is to
make the Essential Forms of letters beautiful in themselves,
giving them the character and finish which come
naturally from a rightly handled tool</em>.
<span class="xxpn" id="p241"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p241]</a></span></p>

<p>If we take the “Roman” types—the letters
with which we are most familiar—and draw them
in single pencil strokes (as a child does when it
“learns its letters”), we get a rough representation
of their Essential Forms (see diagram, fig.
<a href="#fig142">142</a>).</p>

<p>Such letters might be scratched with a point in
wax or clay, and if so used in practice would give
rise to fresh and characteristic
developments,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
but
if we take a “square cut” pen which will give a
thin horizontal stroke and a thick vertical stroke
(figs.
<a href="#fig10">10</a> and <a href="#fig40">40</a>), it will give us the “<em class="italic">straight-pen</em>,”
or simple written, essential forms of these letters
(fig.
<a href="#fig143">143</a>).</p>

<p>These essential forms of straight-pen letters
when compared with the plain line forms show
a remarkable degree of interest, brought about by
the introduction of the thin and thick strokes and
gradated curves, characteristic of pen work.</p>

<p>Certain letters (A, K, M, N, V, W, X, Y, and
k, v, w, x, y) in fig.
<a href="#fig143">143</a> being composed chiefly
of oblique strokes, appear rather heavy. They are
lightened by using a naturally “slanted” pen which
produces thin as well as thick oblique strokes. And
the verticals in M and N are made thin by further
slanting the pen (fig.
<a href="#fig144">144</a>).</p>

<p>To our eyes, accustomed to a traditional finish,
all these forms—in figs.
<a href="#fig143">143</a> and <a href="#fig144">144</a>, but particularly
the slanted pen forms—look incomplete
and unfinished; and it is obvious that the thin
strokes, at least, require marked terminals or <em class="italic">serifs</em>.

<p><em class="italic">Finishing-Strokes.</em>—The pen naturally produces
a variety of finishing-strokes—“heads,” “feet,”
serifs, &#38;c.—each type of which strongly characterises
the alphabet in which it is employed.</p>

<p>The main types (fig.
<a href="#fig145">145</a>) <span class="nowrap">are—</span></p>

<ul>
<li>(a) <em class="italic">Hooks or beaks.</em></li>

<li>(b) <em class="italic">Straight (or curved) strokes</em>, thick or thin
according to the direction of the pen.</li>

<li>(c) <em class="italic">Triangular “heads”</em> (and “feet”), straight or
slanted, and more or less curved and sharpened.</li>

<li>(d) <em class="italic">Thin finishing-curves</em>,
horizontal or oblique.</li></ul>

<p>To give uniformity to the various letters of
an alphabet it is necessary to treat similar parts
as consistently as possible throughout (see No. 5,
p.
<a href="#p239">239</a>). And the remarkable way in which “heads”
impart a “family likeness” to letters closely
resembles the same phenomenon among human
beings (see pp. <a href="#p324">324</a>,
<a href="#p254">254</a>).</p>

<p>If we consider the four types of serif, <em class="italic">as applicable
to straight-pen writing</em>, we <span class="nowrap">find—</span>

</div></div>

<p>For a formal, straight-pen writing, therefore, we
may assume that a form of triangular head is, on
the whole, the most suitable, while some of the
letters may be allowed to end naturally in finishing
hooks and curves.

</div></div>

<p>Heads are easily built up at the ends of thick
strokes, but some practice is required to enable a
penman to make them on the thin strokes properly
and skilfully. On the thin horizontals they are
made with an almost continuous movement of the
point of the nib from the thin stroke itself (see (<em class="italic">a</em>)
to (<em class="italic">h</em>) fig.
<a href="#fig146">146</a>) closely resembling the termination
of some of the thin strokes in the Irish half-uncial
(<a href="#plate06">Plate VI.</a>). On the thin oblique or vertical stems
a thin crossing stroke is first made, and then shaped
<span class="xxpn" id="p247"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p247]</a></span>
with the pen point to meet the stem (see (<em class="italic">i</em>) and (<em class="italic">k</em>)
fig.
<a href="#fig146">146</a>).</p>

<p>We may write out the letters now with their
suitable serifs, and we see that the Pen character
and finish, given to the “Essential, or Skeleton,
Forms” (fig.
<a href="#fig142">142</a>) result in a very formal and highly
finished alphabet (fig.

(<em class="italic">As having the distinguishing characteristics of each

<p>The “<em class="italic">Characteristic Parts</em>” are those parts which
most particularly serve to distinguish one letter from
<span class="xxpn" id="p250"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p250]</a></span>
another (fig.
<a href="#fig149">149</a>). We should therefore, when
constructing letters, give special attention to their
preservation, and sometimes they may even be
accentuated with advantage—always with an eye
to the life-history, or evolution, of the letter in
question, and allowing for the influence of the
special tool with which it is to be made (see <em class="italic">Proportion</em>,
below).</p>

<p>The right proportioning of letters entails the
preservation of their Essential Forms and their
Characteristic Parts, and, provided these are not
<span class="xxpn" id="p252"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p252]</a></span>
seriously interfered with, a certain amount of exaggeration
(and
dwarfing)<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
is allowable in special
cases; particularly in ornamental writings, and
Pen-flourished capitals or terminal letters (see figs.
<a href="#fig79">79</a> and <a href="#fig125">125</a>).</p>

<p>Rational exaggeration usually amounts to the
drawing out or flourishing of tails or free stems, or
branches—very often to the magnifying of a <em class="italic">characteristic
part</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig150">150</a>, &#38; pp. <a href="#p250">250</a>,
<a href="#p331">331</a>). It is
a special form of decoration, and very effective if
used discriminately.</p>

<h4 title="BEAUTY OF FORM">BEAUTY OF FORM
<span class="h4desc">
(<em class="italic">As having beautiful shapes and constructions, so that
each letter is an individual and living whole (not
a mere collection of parts) fitted for the position,
office, and material of the object bearing the inscription</em>)</span></h4>

<p>To choose or construct beautiful forms requires
good taste, and that in its turn requires cultivation,
which comes from the observation of beautiful
forms. Those who are not accustomed to seeing
beautiful things are, in consequence, often uncertain
whether they think a thing beautiful or not.
Some—perhaps all of us—have an intuition for
what is beautiful; but most of us have to achieve
beauty by taking pains.</p>

<p>At the least we are apt to be misled if we label
abstract forms as <em class="italic">essentially beautiful</em> or <em class="italic">essentially ugly</em>—as
by a mistaken <em class="italic">recipe</em> for beauty. For us as
craftsmen “achieving beauty by taking pains,”
means acquiring skill in a special craft and
<span class="xxpn" id="p253"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p253]</a></span>
adapting that skill to a special piece of work.
And perhaps the surest way to learn, is to let
our tools and materials teach us and, as it were,
make beautiful shapes for us.</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Inside Shapes.</em>”—The beauty
of a letter depends very much on its inside shape—<em
class="italic">i.e.</em> the shape of the space enclosed by the
letter form. As this is often overlooked, it may be briefly
referred to. Frequently when it seems difficult to say what is
wrong with a piece of bad lettering, a glance at the inside
shapes will reveal the fault. In <em class="italic">simple
writing</em>, if the pen be properly cut and properly held, these
shapes will generally take care of themselves, and internal
angles or asymmetrical lines which occur are characteristic of
that particular form of penmanship, and not accidental (<em
class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig151">151</a>).</p>

</div></div>

<div class="xxpn" id="p254"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p254]</a></div>

<p>In making <em class="italic">Built-up</em> letters—which have both
outer and inner strokes—the inner strokes should
generally be made first (see p.
<a href="#p121">121</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Plain and Ornamental Forms.</em>—Not only for the
sake of readableness, but to promote a beautiful
and dignified effect, the forms of letters are kept
simple when the text is long. And, generally, the
less frequent the type, the more ornamental may be
its form (see pp. <a href="#p126">126</a>,
<a href="#p210">210</a>, <a href="#p298">298</a>, <a href="#p330">330</a>).</p>

(<em class="italic">As the assimilation of the corresponding parts—“bodies,”
“limbs,” “heads”—and as the “family likeness,”
of the different letters, so that they go well together</em>)</span></h4>

<p>Right uniformity makes for readableness and
beauty, and is the result of good craftsmanship.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Readableness.</em>—Where the text letters are uniform,
the reader is free to give his attention to the
sense of the words, whereas the variations in an
irregular or changing text are
distracting.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p><em class="italic">Beauty.</em>—The abstract beauty-of-uniformity may
be said to lie in this, that the different letters, or
individual elements, “<em class="italic">go well together</em>.” The
beautiful effect of uniform lettering is thus caused
by the united forces, as it were, of all the letters.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Good Craftsmanship.</em>—A pen, or other letter-making
tool, being handled freely and regularly,
the uniform movements of the tool in similar cases
will produce uniform strokes, &#38;c. (On the other
hand, the interruption and loss of freedom to the
<span class="xxpn" id="p255"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p255]</a></span>
writer who is irregular, or who forces an unnatural
variety,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>

&#38;c. (see pp. <a href="#p100">100</a>,

use, however, the craftsman has certain regular
modes of disposing and spacing the lettering, and

<h4 id="p258">SETTING OUT, &#38; FITTING IN</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Ruling.</em>—The approximate sizes of margins and
letters, and the number of lines of text, having been
estimated, guiding lines are ruled on the surface
(see p.
<a href="#p343">343</a>)—a right and a left vertical marginal line,
with the necessary number of horizontals between
them. (In the case of a manuscript, these lines
are ruled faintly (or <em class="italic">grooved</em>), and are left to form
a feature of the page; for inscriptions on other
materials than paper, parchment, &#38;c., they are
generally removed after setting-out.)</p>

<p><em class="italic">Setting-out.</em>—An inscription of any size, or one
requiring complex or very nice arrangement, is set-out
in faint, sketchy outline of lead pencil or chalk.
<em class="italic">Simple writing</em> is not set-out, but such slight calculation
or planning as is necessary is carried out
mentally, or on a scrap of paper. By practice the
scribe, like the compositor, can fit his lettering to
the given space with ease and accuracy. For <em class="italic">writing</em>
and (to a large extent) <em class="italic">printing</em>, both <em class="italic">combine setting-out
and the act of “lettering” in one operation</em>. And
this shows how practice gives foreknowledge of the
“mechanical” part of the work, leaving the mind
free to take pleasure in its performance; and also
how slight—if necessary at all—is the experimental
<em class="italic">setting-out</em> of simple forms required by the practised
workman.</p>

</div></div>

<p><em class="italic">Dividing Monosyllables.</em>—In simple writing—the
beauty of which depends on freedom rather than on
precision—I think that even such an awkward
word as “through” should not be broken. If the
space at the end of a line is insufficient, it should be
left blank, or be filled in with a dash of the pen.
But in the case of words in LARGE CAPITALS,
especially in title-pages and the like, where spacing
<span class="xxpn" id="p259"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p259]</a></span>
is more difficult, and smooth reading less essential,
any word may be divided at any point if the necessity
is sufficiently obvious. But (even when the
division is syllabic) breaking words, as interfering
with the ease of reading, may often be avoided
with advantage, and divisions which give accidental
words, especially when they are objectionable, as
<span class="xxpn" id="p260"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p260]</a></span>
“<span class="smcapitals">TH-ROUGH</span>,” or “<span class="smcapitals">NEIGH-BOUR</span>,” should not be
allowed. Among other ways of dealing with small
spaces, without breaking words, are the <span class="nowrap">following:—</span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Ending with Smaller Letters.</em>—The scribe is always
at liberty to compress his writing <em class="italic">slightly</em>, provided
he does not spoil its readableness or beauty. Occasionally,
without harming either of these, a marked
difference in size of letter may be allowed; one or
more words, or a part of one, or a single letter, being
made smaller (<em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig153">153</a>; see also <a href="#plate05">Plate V.</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Monogrammatic Forms</em>, &#38;c.—In any kind of lettering,
but more particularly in the case of capitals,
where the given space is insufficient for the given
capitals, monogrammatic forms resembling the ordinary
diphthong Æ may be used; or the stem of
one letter may be drawn out, above or below, and
formed into another (<em class="italic">c</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig153">153</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Linking.</em>—Letters which are large enough may
be linked or looped together, or one letter may
be set inside another, or free-stem letters may be
drawn up above the line (<em class="italic">d</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig153">153</a>, but see p.
<a href="#pxvi">26</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Tying up.</em>—One or more words at the end of a
line of writing—particularly in poetry (see p.
<a href="#p095">95</a>)—may
be “tied up,” <em class="italic">i.e.</em> be written above or below the
line, with a pen stroke to connect them to it (fig.
<a href="#fig67">67</a>).</p>

<p>Care must be taken that none of these methods
lead to confusion in the reading. Their “Quaintness”—as
it is sometimes called—is only pleasing
when their contrivance is obviously made necessary.</p>


<h4>“MASSED WRITING” &#38; “FINE WRITING”</h4>

<p>We may distinguish two characteristic modes of
treating an inscription, in which the treatment of
the letter is bound up with the treatment of the
spacing (fig.
<a href="#fig154">154</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p262"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p262]</a></span></p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 154.</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>“<em class="italic">Massed Writing</em>” (<em class="italic">Close Spacing</em>).—The written
or printed page is very commonly <em class="italic">set close</em>, or
“massed,” so that the letters support and enforce
one another, their individual beauty being merged
in and giving beauty to the whole. The closeness
of the <em class="italic">letters</em> in each word keeps the <em class="italic">words</em> distinct,
so that but little space is required between
them,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
and <em class="italic">the lines of writing are made close together</em> (ascending
and descending stems being shortened, if necessary,
for this purpose).</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Fine Writing</em>” (<em class="italic">Wide Spacing</em>).—An inscription
in “Fine Writing” may be spaced widely to display
the finished beauty of the letters, or to give free
play to the penman (or letter-craftsman). It consists
generally of a number of <em class="italic">distinct lines of Writing</em>
(or other lettering).</p>

<p>The two modes may be contrasted broadly,
<span class="nowrap">thus—</span></p>

<p>These two modes may not have been recognised
by the ancient letter-craftsmen: their comparison
here is intended chiefly as a stimulus to definite
thought, <em class="italic">not</em> as a hard-and-fast division of two
“styles”; for there may be any number of possible
compromises between them. In practice, however,
it will be found convenient to distinguish them as
<em class="italic">two modes of treating</em> <span class="smcapitals">LINES OF WRITING</span> <em class="italic">which produce
markedly different effects, the one, as it were, of</em> <span class="smcapitals">COLOUR</span>,
<em class="italic">the other of</em> <span class="smcapitals">FORM</span>.</p>

<p>Plates <a href="#plate11">XI.</a>, <a href="#plate13">XIII.</a>,
<a href="#plate14">XIV.</a>, <a href="#plate15">XV.</a>,
<a href="#plate17">XVII.</a> may be
taken as examples of “Massed Writing,” Plates
<a href="#plate04">IV.</a>,
<a href="#plate05">V.</a>, <a href="#plate06">VI.</a>, <a href="#plate07">VII.</a>,
<a href="#plate09">IX.</a>, (<a href="#plate21">XXI.</a>) of “Fine Writing”; the
other plates suggest compromises between the two.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Poetry</em> (see p.
<a href="#p095">95</a>), or any text consisting of, or
which is conveniently broken up into <em class="italic">unequal lines</em>,
may be treated as “Fine Writing.” There is no objection
to a <em class="italic">straight left-hand edge</em> with an <em class="italic">irregular
right-hand
edge</em>,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
where the cause of the irregularity
<span class="xxpn" id="p264"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p264]</a></span>
is natural and obvious, and no fault of the scribe’s.
Such an arrangement, or rather, <em class="italic">straightforward
writing</em>, of poetry is often the best by virtue of its
freedom and simplicity (see p.
<a href="#p371">371</a>).</p>

<p>In many cases, however, a more formal and
finished treatment of an irregular line text is to be
preferred (especially in inscriptions on stone, metal,
&#38;c.), and the most natural arrangement is then an
approximately symmetrical one, inclining to “Fine
Writing” in treatment. This is easily obtained in
inscriptions which are previously set-out, but a good
plan—certainly the best for MSS.—is to sort the
lines of the text into <em class="italic">longs</em> and <em class="italic">shorts</em> (and sometimes
<em class="italic">medium</em> lines), and to set-in or indent the short lines
two, three, or more letters. The indentations on
the <em class="italic">left</em> balance the accidental irregularities on the
<em class="italic">right</em> (fig.
<a href="#fig154">154</a>, and <a href="#plate04">Plate IV.</a>), and give an appearance
of symmetry to the page (see <em class="italic">Phrasing</em>, p.
<a href="#p384">384</a>).</p>

<p>Either mode of spacing (<em class="italic">close</em> or <em class="italic">wide</em>) may be
carried to an unwise or ridiculous extreme. “Leading”
the lines of type was much in vogue a hundred
years ago, in what was then regarded as “high-class”
printing. Too often the wide-spaced line
and “grand” manner of the eighteenth-century
printer was pretentious rather than effective: this
was partly due to the degraded type which he
used, but form, arrangement, and expression all
tended to be artificial. Of late years a rich,
closely massed page has again become fashionable.
Doubtless there has been a reaction in this from the
eighteenth century to an earlier and better manner,
but the effect is sometimes overdone, and the real
ease and comfort of the reader has been sacrificed to
his rather imaginary æstheticism.</p>

<p>By attaching supreme importance to readableness,
<span class="xxpn" id="p265"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p265]</a></span>
the letter-craftsman gains at least a rational
basis for his work, and is saved from the snares
which lurk in all, even in the best, modes and
fashions.</p>

<h4>EVEN SPACING</h4>

<p>In the spacing of a given inscription on a limited
surface, where a comparatively large size of letter
is required, what little space there is to spare
should generally be distributed evenly and consistently
(<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig155">155</a>). Lavish expenditure of space
on the margins would necessitate an undue
crowding<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
of the lettering (<em class="italic">b</em>), and wide
interspacing<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
would allow insufficient margins (<em class="italic">c</em>)—either arrangement
suggesting inconsistency (but see p.
<a href="#p352">352</a>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<em class="italic">A given margin looks larger the heavier
the mass of the
text</em>,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>
and <em class="italic">smaller the lighter the mass of
the text</em>. And, therefore, if lettering be spread out,
as in “Fine Writing,” the margins should be extra
wide to have their true comparative value. The
space available for a given inscription may in this
way largely determine the arrangement of the
lettering, comparatively <em class="italic">small</em> and <em class="italic">large</em> spaces
suggesting respectively “<em class="italic">Massed Writing</em>” and
“<em class="italic">Fine Writing</em>” (see p.
<a href="#p262">262</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s2" id="fig155">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 155.</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>In <em class="italic">certain decorative inscriptions</em>, where letters are
merely treated as decorative forms—readableness
<span class="xxpn" id="p267"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p267]</a></span>
being a matter of little or no moment—the treatment
of the spacing is adapted to a particular surface;
and, for <span class="nowrap">example:—</span></p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig156">
<img src="images/i267.jpg" width="600" height="393" alt="" />

</div></div>

<h4>THEORY &#38; PRACTICE</h4>

<p>The above discussion of theories and “rules”
for the construction and arrangement of good
lettering is intended to suggest some useful methods—not
to provoke excessive fitting or planning, but
rather to avoid it. Straightforwardness is perhaps
the greatest virtue in a craft, and whatever “rules”
it may break through, it is refreshing and charming.</p>

<p>An excellent example for the scribe or inscription
maker is the method of an early printer, who
had only four or five sorts of type—say, “Small-Letters”
and “Capitals” (Roman and Italic) and
“Large Capitals,” and who, without any elaborate
“design,” simply put his types into their proper
<span class="xxpn" id="p268"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p268]</a></span>
places, and then pulled off his pleasant sheets of
“commonplace” printing.</p>

<p>The scribe should choose the best and simplest
forms and arrangements, and master them before
going further; he should have a few definite types
“at his finger tips,” and, for everyday use, a matter-of-course
way of putting them down on paper.</p>

<p>Ambiguity is one of the greatest faults in a craft.
It comes often from vague ambitions. One may
be inspired by good ambitions, but the immediate
concern of the craftsman is to know what he is
capable of doing at the present, and to do it.</p>

<p>Let the meaning of your work be obvious unless
it is designed purely for your own amusement. A
good craftsman seeks out the <em class="italic">commonplace</em> and tries
to master it, knowing that “originality” comes of
necessity, and not of searching.</p>

years ago, the Roman Capitals have held the supreme
place among letters for readableness and beauty.
They are the best forms for the grandest and most
important inscriptions, and, in regard to lettering
generally, a very good rule to follow is: <em class="italic">When in
doubt, use Roman Capitals</em>.</p>

<p>The penman may with advantage devote some
study to a fine monumental type of Roman Capital
(such as that of the Trajan Column Inscription:
Plates <a href="#plate01">I.</a> and <a href="#plate02">II.</a>), and endeavour to embody its virtues

<p>There is a point of division in these letters about

<p>These forms are related to the B, E forms, but

<h4>UPPER &#38; LOWER PARTS</h4>

<p>In the letters B, E, H, K, X (A), F, R, P (S),
Y there is generally a tendency to enlarge the
lower part, the cross-bar—or division—being set
above mid-height. This tendency may reasonably
be accounted for as <span class="nowrap">follows:—</span></p>

<p>The natural division of <span class="fsize2 verta-mid">B</span>, <span class="fsize2 verta-mid">E</span>, <span class="fsize2 verta-mid">H</span>,
<span class="fsize2 verta-mid">K</span>, &#38; <span class="fsize2 verta-mid">X</span>, regarded as abstract forms, would
be symmetrical—<em class="italic">i.e.</em> at the centre of the
stem.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
In order that its <em class="italic">apparent position</em> may be central,
however, it is necessary, for optical reasons, to make
<span class="xxpn" id="p274"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p274]</a></span>
its actual position above the
centre.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
And further,
by a reasonable enlargement of the lower part,
these letters acquire a greater appearance of stability.</p>

<p>It would be well, I think, for the letter-craftsman
to begin by making such divisions at the <em class="italic">apparent
centre</em> (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> very slightly above mid-height; see
E, F, X, <a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>), so keeping most nearly to the
<em class="italic">essential forms</em> (see p.
<a href="#p275">275</a>). Later he might consider
the question of stability (see B, <a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>).
The exaggerated raising (or lowering) of the
division associated with “Art Lettering” is illegible
and ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="fsize2 verta-mid">A</span> The lower part is essentially bigger, and
the cross-bar is not raised, as that would
make the top part disproportionately small.</p>

<p><span class="fsize2 verta-mid">F</span> usually follows E, but being asymmetrical and
open below it may, if desired, be made with
the bar at—or even slightly below—the actual
centre.</p>

<p><span class="fsize2 verta-mid">R</span> In early forms the bow was frequently
rather large (see <a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>), but it is safer
to make the tail—the characteristic part—more
pronounced (see Plates
<a href="#plate03">III.</a>, <a href="#plate24">XXIV.</a>).</p>

<p><span class="fsize2 verta-mid">P</span> The characteristic part of P is the bow,
which may therefore be a little larger than
the bow of R (see <a href="#plate03">Plate III.</a>).</p>

<p><span class="fsize2 verta-mid">S</span> In the best types of this letter the upper
and lower parts are approximately equal;
there is a tendency slightly to enlarge the lower
<span class="xxpn" id="p275"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p275]</a></span>
part. (In Uncial and early round-hands the <em class="italic">top</em>
part was larger: see Plates
<a href="#plate04">IV.</a> to <a href="#plate07">VII.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="fsize2 verta-mid">Y</span> varies: the upper part may be less than that
of X, or somewhat larger.</p>

<h4 title="ESSENTIAL OR STRUCTURAL FORMS">
ESSENTIAL OR STRUCTURAL FORMS
<span class="h4desc">
<em class="italic">The essential or structural forms</em> (see p.
<a href="#p240">240</a>) <em class="italic">are the
simplest forms which preserve the characteristic structure,
distinctiveness, and proportions of each individual letter</em>.</span></h4>

<p>The letter-craftsman must have a clear idea of
the <em class="italic">skeletons</em> of his letters. While in every case the
precise form which commends itself to him is matter
for his individual choice, it is suggested in the
following discussion of a typical form—the Roman
B—that the rationale of his selection (whether
conscious or unconscious) is in brief <em class="italic">to determine
what is</em> <span class="smcapitals">ABSOLUTELY</span> <em class="italic">essential to a form, and then how
far this may be amplified in the direction of the</em> <span class="smcapitals">PRACTICALLY</span>
<em class="italic">essential</em>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The letter B reduced to its simplest (<em class="italic">curved-bow</em>) form—<em class="italic">i.e.</em>
to the bare necessity of its distinctive structure—comprises <em class="italic">a
perpendicular stem spanned by two equal, circular bows</em> (<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig160">160</a>).</p>

<p>In amplifying such a form for practical or æsthetic reasons,
it is well as a rule not to exceed one’s object—in this case to
determine a reasonable (though arbitrary) standard essential
form of B, having a distinctive and proportionate (<em class="italic">f</em>) structure.
We may increase the arcs of the bows till their width is nearly
equal to their height (<em class="italic">b</em>), make their outer ends meet the ends
of the stem (<em class="italic">c</em>), and their inner ends coincide (<em class="italic">d</em>). Raising
the division till its apparent position is at or about the middle of
the stem entails a <em class="italic">proportionate increase</em> of width in the lower
part, and a corresponding decrease in the upper part (<em class="italic">e</em>).</p></div>

<p>The very idea of an essential form excludes the
<em class="italic">un</em>necessary, and its further amplification is apt to
take from its <em class="italic">distinctiveness</em> and legibility. Where
no limits are set, modification is apt to become
<span class="xxpn" id="p276"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p276]</a></span>
exaggeration. And, though special forms and
<em class="italic">ornamental letters</em> may be produced by “reasonable
exaggeration” (<em class="italic">k</em>, <em class="italic">l</em>, <em class="italic">m</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig161">161</a>), if the tool be kept
<span class="xxpn" id="p278"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p278]</a></span>
under proper control, yet, generally, such <em class="italic">structural</em>
changes do not improve the appearance of the plain
letter forms.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>We may test our “Standard” (<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig161">161</a>) by considering the
effects of further amplification.</p>

<p>(1) <em class="italic">Raising the

slightly is permissible (<em class="italic">b</em>, fig <a href="#fig161">161</a>)—too

tends to dissociate the bows from the stem, making the letter

<a href="#fig161">161</a>).</p></div>

<p>Widening and narrowing are both allowable and

<p>That the

Essential Forms of letters, can easily be proved by
a little practical experience of the natural action of

<a href="#fig162">162</a>).
And the penman—or indeed any other letter-maker—is
advised to allow the pen to train his hand to

make the proper strokes automatically: then he
may begin to master and control the pen, making

<div class="dropcapa">A</div>

<p>1. A pointed form of A, M, and N (see
<a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>) may be suitable for inscriptions
in stone, &#38;c., but in pen work the top is
preferably <em class="italic">hooked</em> (fig.
<a href="#fig167">167</a>), <em class="italic">beaked</em> (fig.
<a href="#fig147">147</a>), or <em class="italic">broken</em> (fig.
<a href="#fig158">158</a>), or specially
marked in some way, as this part (both in Capital
A and small a) has generally been (fig.
<a href="#fig189">189</a>).</p>

<p>2.&#160;The oblique strokes in A, K, M, N, R, V,
W, X, Y, whether thick or thin, are naturally
finished with a short point <em class="italic">inside</em> the letter and a
long, sharp point, or <em class="italic">beak</em>, <em class="italic">outside</em> (see serifs of oblique
strokes, p.
<a href="#p289">289</a>).</p>

<p>3.&#160;The thin stem may be drawn out below for
an occasional form (see F, 3).</p>

<div class="dropcapa">B</div>

<p>1. B, D, R, and P are generally best made
<em class="italic">round-shouldered</em> (fig.
<a href="#fig162">162</a> &#38; <em class="italic">Addenda</em>, p.
<a href="#pxxvi">26</a>).</p>

<p>2.&#160;B, D, E, F, P, R (and T) have generally
an <em class="italic">angle</em> between the stem and the top
horizontal, while
<span class="xxpn" id="p281"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p281]</a></span></p>

<p>3.&#160;<em class="italic">below</em> in B, D, E (and L) the stem curves or
blends with the horizontal.</p>

<p>4.&#160;See O, 2.</p>

<div class="dropcapa">C</div>

<p>1. C, G, and S; the top horizontals or
‘arms’ may be straighter than the lower
arms, or <em class="italic">vice versâ</em> (see figs.
<a href="#fig167">167</a> and <a href="#fig206">206</a>).</p>

<p>2.&#160;C, G, and S; the <em class="italic">inside</em> curve is best
continuous—from the ‘bow’ to the ends
of the ‘arms’—not being broken by the serifs, and</p>

<p>3.&#160;it is best to preserve an unbroken inside curve
at the termination of all free arms and stems in
built-up Roman Capitals. In C, G, S, E, F, L,
T, and Z the upper and lower arms are curved on
the <em class="italic">inside</em>, and squared or slightly pointed outside
(the vertical stems curve on either side) (fig.
<a href="#fig163">163</a>).</p>

<p>4.&#160;‘Arms’ are best shaped and curved rather
gradually out to the terminal or serif, which then
is an actual part of the letter, not an added lump
(p.
<a href="#p289">289</a>).</p>

<p>5.&#160;See O, 2.</p>

<div class="dropcapa">D</div>

<p>1. See B, 1.</p>

<p>2.&#160;See B, 2 and 3.</p>

<p>3.&#160;The curve may be considered as
springing from the foot of the stem, and
may therefore for an occasional form be
separated from the stem at the <em class="italic">top</em> (<em class="italic">D</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig177">177</a>).</p>

<p>4.&#160;See O, 2.</p>

<div class="dropcapa">E</div>

<p>1. See B, 2 and 3.</p>

<p>2.&#160;See C, 3 and 4.</p>

<p>3.&#160;The lower limb in E, L (and Z) is
often drawn out: these, however, are properly
to be regarded as <em class="italic">occasional</em> or <em class="italic">special</em>
<span class="xxpn" id="p282"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p282]</a></span>
forms: the lower serif of this type commonly points
out (see figs.
<a href="#fig206">206</a>, <a href="#fig188">188</a>).</p>

<p>4.&#160;E’s <em class="italic">three arms</em> (&#38; F’s two) are approximately
<em class="italic">equal in length</em> in the best early forms (<a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>, &#38;c.).</p>

<div class="dropcapa">F</div>

<p>1. See B, 2.</p>

<p>2.&#160;See C, 3 and 4 (and E, 4 <em class="italic">above</em>).</p>

<p>3.&#160;One or more (the development of the
letter and tradition may decide which) of
the free stems of A, F, G, H, I, J, K, L,
M, N, P, R, T, V, W, X, Y may be drawn out
for occasional forms (see fig.
<a href="#fig188">188</a>).</p>

<p>4.&#160;The elongated stems of F, I, J, P, T, Y may
hang below the line, or they may (occasionally)
stand on the line and overtop the other letters.</p>

<div class="dropcapa">
<img src="images/i282c1.jpg" width="90" height="90" alt="G" />
</div>

<p>1. See C, 1, 2, 3, and 4.</p>

<p>2.&#160;The stem may be drawn out below
the line (F, 3).</p>

<p>3. The stem sometimes forms an angle
with the lower ‘arm’ (this is safest: see
fig.
<a href="#fig148">148</a>), sometimes they blend (fig.
<a href="#fig147">147</a>).</p>

<p>4. The point of the lower ‘arm’ may project a
<em class="italic">very little</em> beyond the stem to mark the <em class="italic">outer</em> angle.</p>

<p>5. The wholly curved “gothic”
<img class="letter3" src="images/i282c2.jpg" width="90" height="90" alt="Gothic G" />
(and also the other <em class="italic">round</em> letters: see p.
<a href="#p119">119</a>) may be introduced <em class="italic">occasionally</em> among
Roman Capitals.</p>

<p>6. See O, 2.</p>

<div class="dropcapa">H</div>

<p>The <em class="italic">left-hand</em> stem is occasionally
drawn out above (F, 3 &#38; <em class="italic">comp.</em> fig.
<a href="#fig03">3</a>), and</p>

<p>2. this form is sometimes associated
with an ornamental cross-bar (fig.
<a href="#fig189">189</a>).</p>

<p>3. H and N may slightly widen out <em class="italic">above</em>.</p>

<div class="dropcapa" id="p283">I</div>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—With regard to the use of I for
J (and V for U): this is associated so much
with the Latin usage, that it is perhaps permissible
still in
Latin.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
But for modern English,
in which these letters are strongly differentiated, the
tailed J and the round U are to be preferred. Besides
the suspicion of affectation attaching to the
other mode, its strangeness gives an appearance of
awkwardness—almost amounting to illegibility—to
common words, such as “A QVAINT IVG”
or “IAM IAR.” And, at the least, very careful
<span class="xxpn" id="p284"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p284]</a></span>
discrimination is desirable: “IVBILATE” may
pass, but “IVIVBE” is not really readable.</p>

<p>3. The tail of the J may be slight, provided it be
distinct, and the second stem of the U may match the first
(fig.
<a href="#fig158">158</a>); the ugly
<img class="letter3" src="images/i284c1.jpg"

<div class="dropcapa">K</div>

<p>1. The stem is sometimes drawn out
above (F, 3).</p>

<p>2. Both arms are occasionally lengthened,
and the width of the letter increased, by
joining the thin arm to the stem lower
down; the thick arm, or tail, then springs from
the side of the thin arm (<em class="italic">compare</em>
<img class="letter3" src="images/i284c3.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="R" />).
This tends away from the essential, and is therefore a
less safe form.</p>

<p>3. The tail may be curved or drawn out occasionally
(see <em class="italic">Tails</em>, pp. <a href="#p289">289</a>–<a

is much spread out <img class="letter3" src="images/i284c4.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="M" />.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—There are inscriptional forms of M
<span class="xxpn" id="p285"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p285]</a></span>
and N without the top serif (<a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>). But the
pen forms and others have top serifs, and these
commonly extend <em class="italic">outward</em>—tending to <em class="italic">beaks</em> (see
A, 1 and 2)—rather than <em class="italic">in</em>. (V, W, X, Y (and
N) show a similar tendency—see p.

<p>4. The first stem is drawn out below
the line for an occasional form (most suitable
for an Initial Letter): the right-hand stem is
very occasionally raised (when a final letter) (F, 3).</p>

<p>5. <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The stems of N (the only vertical

tend sometimes to be thicker: see <a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a></p>

forms and, in a sense, of the whole

<p>4. The bow of P appears to be attached (to the

<div class="dropcapa">Q</div>

<p>1. Q resembles O with a tail: see O.</p>

<p>2. There are many characteristic varieties
of the tail: see <em class="italic">Tails</em> (pp. <a href="#p289">289</a>–<a

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Q being always followed

<p>1. See B, 1 and 2.</p>

<p>2. See O, 2.</p>

<p>3. In the form nearest the essential, the
junction of the Bow and the Tail touches
the stem. If the tail springs from the curve
of the bow (<a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>) greater care in construction
is necessary (compare K). The treatment of the
tail is very important. It may end in a serif (see
A, 2), or it may be curved and pointed (see <em class="italic">Tails</em>,
pp. <a href="#p289">289</a>–<a

<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<em class="italic">Serifs</em> of some sort are practically essential
to the proper characterisation of an alphabet (see
figs.
<a href="#fig147">147</a>, <a href="#fig148">148</a>,
<a href="#fig162">162</a>), and should generally have a
certain uniformity (p.
<a href="#p324">324</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p289"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p289]</a></span></p>

<p>(<em class="italic">b</em>) The serifs, &#38;c., of simple-written forms are
treated at p.
<a href="#p244">244</a> (see fig.
<a href="#fig145">145</a>).</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">c</em>) In <em class="italic">Versals</em> and certain other forms the mode
of making requires the serif to be a distinct addition
to the letter (see figs.
<a href="#fig116">116</a>, <a href="#fig166">166</a>).</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">d</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig163">163</a>) In the finest <em class="italic">built-up</em> A B Cs serifs are
treated as the actual finishing and shaping of the
ends of the <em class="italic">stems and branches</em>, rather than as added
parts (see C, 3 &#38; 4, p.
<a href="#p281">281</a> and p.
<a href="#p240">240</a>). This
particularly affects the construction of the thin
strokes (see figs.
<a href="#fig165">165</a>, <a href="#fig167">167</a>).</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">e</em>) <em class="italic">The serifs of the oblique strokes</em> in A, K, M, N,
R, V, W, X, Y are commonly not placed centrally,
but projecting in the direction of the stroke (<em class="italic">i.e.</em>
away from the letter, thus:
<img class="letter3" src="images/i289c1.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="X" />),
branching out
from the parent stem (see <em class="italic">tails</em>, below), and avoiding
an acute angle (as
<img class="letter3" src="images/i289c2.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="T" />).
This has tended to
produce <em class="italic">hooks</em> and <em class="italic">beaks</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig163">163</a>), which are
often used for the oblique strokes, particularly of
A and N (see figs.
<a href="#fig189">189</a>, <a href="#fig158">158</a>), and the tails of K
and R (see below).</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">f</em>) There is a similar natural tendency to <em class="italic">hook</em>
or <em class="italic">flourish</em> the terminals of <em class="italic">vertical stems</em> on the left,
particularly of B, D, I, J, K, L, P, R; less often
of E, F, H. A very interesting and beautiful effect
may be obtained by delicately curving down the
upper serifs on <em class="italic">the left</em> (like thin <em class="italic">beaks</em>). Such serifs
are sometimes very slightly <em class="italic">turned up on the right</em>,
and it may be noted that this tendency of the
“horizontals” to <em class="italic">curve up and forward</em>
<img class="letter5" src="images/i289c3.jpg"
width="315" height="90" alt="X" />
is natural and characteristic of freely made, vigorous
lettering (see Uncial T, pen dashes, &#38;c., figs.
<a href="#fig169">169</a>, <a href="#fig125">125</a>, &#38;c.).</p>

<div class="figc-s1a" id="fig163">
<img src="images/i290.jpg" width="479" height="800" alt="" />

<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 163.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">TAILS.</em>—(<em class="italic">a</em>) The tails of K, Q, R
<span class="xxpn" id="p291"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p291]</a></span>
(and J)—and the strokes in A, F, G, I, M, N, P, Y, &#38;c.,
which may be drawn out tail-wise—play an important
part in the right construction, and the occasional
decoration, of plain lettering. They may
end either in <em class="italic">serifs</em> or in <em class="italic">curves</em> (see <em class="italic">SERIFS</em> (<em class="italic">e</em>),
above, and fig.
<a href="#fig188">188</a>).</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">b</em>) <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—It is a characteristic of vigorous forms
that <em class="italic">branches, &#38;c., stand out well from their stems</em>
(pp. <a href="#p219">219</a>, (<em class="italic">e</em>)
<a href="#p289">289</a>, (N) <a href="#p271">271</a>), and a good tail should
stand out well from the letter (K, Q, fig.
<a href="#fig167">167</a>).</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">c</em>) An excellent form of tail for ordinary use,
combining strength and grace, consists of a (strong)
<em class="italic">straight stroke</em> ending more or less abruptly in a
(graceful) <em class="italic">finishing curve</em>.</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">d</em>) An extraordinarily long tail requires a slight
double curve to take off its stiffness.</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">e</em>) A good tail may be made by the addition of
a double curved stroke on the under side of a
straight tail (or of a single curve above).</p>

<p>(<em class="italic">f</em>) In treating the tail of J, or the drawn-out
stems of A, F, G, I, M, N, P, Y, it is important
to preserve the essential straightness of the stems.
Therefore, if a <em class="italic">finishing curve</em> be used, its size is
related to the length of the straight stroke, and,
unless this be extraordinarily long, the curve is
usually made rather small and abrupt. A curve
which is too large is apt to weaken the form and
“pull it out of the straight” (<em class="italic">g</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig163">163</a>).</p>

<h4>BUILT-UP FORMS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Built-up Letters</em> are composed of compound
strokes (<em class="italic">c</em>, <em class="italic">d</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig164">164</a>); <em class="italic">Simple-written Letters</em> of
simple strokes (<em class="italic">a</em>, <em class="italic">b</em>).</p>

<p>The Pen being <em class="italic">an instrument which produces</em>
<span class="xxpn" id="p292"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p292]</a></span>
<em class="italic">definite thick and thin strokes on a smooth surface</em>, is
perfectly adapted to the construction of either
simple or compound forms; <em class="italic">other tools</em>, such as the
stylus, needle, graver, &#38;c., <em class="italic">produce various scratches,
stitches, or cuts, generally of the nature of rather varying
thin strokes</em>, and to produce thick strokes a
<em class="italic">building-up</em> process is required.</p>

<p>In making built-up forms the control exerted by
the tool is less obvious, and more depends upon the
craftsman, who must therefore use greater care
and judgment. Not only is it possible, but, occasionally,
it may be desirable to depart from the
more obvious tool-forms; though generally the
more simply and naturally <em class="italic">tool-made</em> a form is,
the better it is.</p>

<p>The fine early inscriptions are supposed to have
been first <em class="italic">drawn</em> or <em class="italic">painted</em> (in outline) and then
cut into the stone. The <em class="italic">chisel forms</em> were doubtless
affected in this way by <em class="italic">brush</em> (and indirectly
by <em class="italic">pen</em>) <em class="italic">forms</em>, but these were of the simplest—nothing
was sketched in that was unfitted for the
chisel to make into a natural and true <em class="italic">chisel-form</em>.</p>

<p>The action of the brush or “pencil” to a certain
extent resembles that of the pen, but their effects
are really distinct. In contrasting pen-made and
brush-made letters, we may observe that <em class="italic">a pen form
tends to abrupt changes from thin to thick: a brush form
to gradation</em> (fig.
<a href="#fig164">164</a>). The pen particularly affects
curved strokes (<em class="italic">comp. a</em> &#38; <em class="italic">b</em>), generally making them
more quick and abrupt (or even <em class="italic">broken</em>, see * * <em class="italic">c</em>),
than brush curves. The brush will give more graceful
and finished but less uniform letters (see p.
<a href="#p376">376</a>).</p>

<p>The character of a pen-letter depends greatly on
the <em class="italic">nib-width</em> (p.
<a href="#p324">324</a>), and <em class="italic">narrow</em>, <em class="italic">medium</em>, or <em class="italic">broad</em>
nibs are used according to the type of letter required.
<span class="xxpn" id="p293"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p293]</a></span></p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig164">
<img src="images/i293.jpg" width="600" height="593" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 164.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A narrow nib may be used for special (built-up)
Initials and Capitals, which are <em class="italic">drawn</em> rather than
<em class="italic">written</em> (<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig165">165</a>). The horizontal arms (made
by the pen held horizontally) are markedly affected,
and if a very fine nib were used, the necessity of
strengthening and thickening them would tend
further to reduce the pen character.</p>

<p>A broad nib gives strong, uniform pen-letters (<em class="italic">b</em>).</p>

<p>For ordinary use letters are perhaps best made
with a “medium” nib (<em class="italic">c</em>). The width of the
ordinary writing-pen, or rather narrower, gives a
good proportion for initials, &#38;c. (see pp. <a href="#p118">118</a>,
<a href="#p218">218</a>).</p>

<p>In MS. books the early built-up Capitals were
<span class="xxpn" id="p294"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p294]</a></span>
commonly of a rather severe type—approaching
the Roman Capital, but having the sharp contrast
between the <em class="italic">thicks</em> and the <em class="italic">thins</em> characteristic of
pen-letters (fig.
<a href="#fig166">166</a>). They make very simple and
effective “Versals.”</p>

<p>A more highly finished type of pen-made Roman
Capital may be made by blending the serifs and
stems (<em class="italic">d</em>, p.
<a href="#p289">289</a>): it is nearer to the inscriptional
form, but it exhibits a more curved and supple
<span class="xxpn" id="p296"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p296]</a></span>
outline, which comes of natural pen-strokes (fig.
<a href="#fig167">167</a>).</p>

<p>The remarks in Chapter VII. on the treatment
of the more elastic “Gothic” Versal (a free variety
<span class="xxpn" id="p297"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p297]</a></span>
of the Roman) may be taken as applying generally
to (Coloured) Built-up Capitals—due allowance
being made for the characteristic differences of the
various types.</p>

<h4>SIMPLE-WRITTEN CAPITALS</h4>

<p>“<em class="italic">Rustic Capitals</em>” (fig.
<a href="#fig04">4</a>) may be referred to
here as typical, simple-written capitals. Though
not a very practical
form,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a>
they are full of suggestions
for a semi-ornamental lettering in which the
pronounced treatment of the <em class="italic">heads and feet</em> might
be a feature (<em class="italic">comp.</em> fig.
<a href="#fig203">203</a>). They were used as
ornamental letters for titles and the like (see Plates
<a href="#plate08">VIII.</a>, <a href="#plate09">IX.</a>, &#38;c.) for centuries after they had gone
out of ordinary use.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Simple-written Roman Capitals.</em>—(Examples:
Plates
<a href="#plate03">III.</a>, <a href="#plate18">XVIII.</a>,
<a href="#plate19">XIX.</a>, <a href="#plate21">XXI.</a>, figs.
<a href="#fig147">147</a>, <a href="#fig148">148</a>,
<a href="#fig168">168</a>, <a href="#fig175">175</a>,
<a href="#fig179">179</a>. See also pp. <a href="#p247">247</a>,
<a href="#p429">429</a>.)</p>

<p><em class="italic">Uncials.</em>—(Examples: see p.
<a href="#p300">300</a>.)</p>

<p><em class="italic">Simple-written Capitals</em> ordinarily conform to
the writing line—as set by the small text (p.
<a href="#p082">82</a>).
This applies even where several <em class="italic">words</em> in capitals
have to be inserted in the small text, though in
special cases where these might look too crowded
such capitals might be written on alternate lines.</p>

<p>Used for <em class="italic">Initial Words</em>, <em class="italic">headings</em>, <em class="italic">whole pages</em>, or
<em class="italic">books</em>, in black or colour, they are written with
greater freedom and accorded more special treatment
(see pp. <a href="#p298">298</a>,
<a href="#p299">299</a>).</p>

<p>Simple-written Capitals are best composed of
sharp, clean, pen-strokes: they may be quite plain
<span class="xxpn" id="p298"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p298]</a></span>
or more or less decorative (fig.
<a href="#fig168">168</a>), subject to the
general rule that <em class="italic">the fewer the number of letters or the
more ornamental their office, the more elaborate and
fanciful may be the forms employed</em> (see p.
<a href="#p294">294</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig168">
<img src="images/i298.jpg" width="600" height="599" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 168.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A freely used pen naturally produces occasional
varieties for special or ornamental purposes: these
tend to elegance and drawn out flourished strokes
(p.
<a href="#p331">331</a>); they vary chiefly in being extra
large.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p299"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p299]</a></span>
Several of these may be used with fine effect in
a page of plain Capitals, their “<em class="italic">weight</em>” (and
generally their colour) being the same as that of
the text (see <a href="#plate05">Plate V.</a>, and p.
<a href="#p328">328</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Whole Books or Pages written in Capitals.</em>—A very
grand effect may be produced by these at the
expense of a little more time and material than
a Small-letter MS. entails. The lines of writing
are commonly made one-letter-height apart: this
requires ordinary simple ruling—the capitals being
written between every alternate pair of lines (see
p.
<a href="#p412">412</a>).</p>

<p>Such writing may conveniently be treated as
“<em class="italic">Fine</em> Writing” (p.
<a href="#p262">262</a>). It justifies the use of
wider margins. It is generally more difficult (and
less necessary) to keep the right-hand edge as
straight as a small text permits. The irregularities
of this edge may be balanced by setting out in the
<em class="italic">left</em> margin the first letters of sentences, verses, and
the like (see p.
<a href="#p264">264</a>). Such initials may be written
larger or more ornamentally as suggested above;
or, if built-up Letters are required, plain, rather
slender Roman Capitals are the most suitable:
these look best in burnished gold.</p>

<p>Perhaps the finest and most beautiful work which
the penman can produce, is a book written entirely
in <em class="italic">gold</em><a id="FNanchor_74" href="#footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
<em class="italic">capitals</em><a id="FNanchor_75" href="#footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
<em class="italic">on purple vellum</em> (see pp. <a href="#p164">164</a>,
<a href="#p175">175</a>).
This is only possible in special cases, but a book
rightly so made being illuminated from within, has
an incomparable simplicity and grandeur, surpassing
that of the finest post-decorated and illuminated
manuscripts.

<h4>CAPITALS &#38; SMALL-LETTERS</h4>

<p>During the development of Small-Letters from Capitals
but little distinction was made in their use, and such
capital forms as <span class="smcapitals">N</span> and <span
class="smcapitals">R</span> were freely and promiscuously
used in the <em class="italic">round minuscule</em> writings,
together with the small-letters <em class="bold">n</em> and <em
class="bold">r</em> (see Plates <a href="#plate06">VI.</a>, <a href="#plate07">VII.</a>). On the other hand,
Small-Letter forms were frequently written larger and used as
initials. In Irish and Anglo-Irish MSS. these were filled inside
with green, yellow, or red, and surrounded outside with red
dots, or otherwise decorated with colour (see fig.
<a href="#fig07">7</a>, and <a href="#plate06">Plate
VI.</a>).</p>

<p>In early MSS., therefore, one does not find an
alphabet of Simple-Written Capitals, which is
peculiar to a given small text. But we may
employ a kindred capital—such as the round
<em class="italic">Uncial</em> for the round <em class="italic">Half-Uncial</em>. And a fitting
alphabet may always be constructed, from the
“Roman” or “Uncial” types of Capitals (<em class="italic">footnote</em>,
p.
<a href="#p300">300</a>), by taking the same pen with which the
small-letters have been made and using it in a
similar manner: “straight” for “straight-pen”
writing, and “slanted” for “slanted-pen” writing
(see figs.
<a href="#fig147">147</a>, <a href="#fig148">148</a>).</p>

<p>When in doubt as to the type of Capital—for
any purpose—use Roman Capitals.</p>

as <em class="italic">fine writing</em> (p.
<a href="#p262">262</a>), and <em class="italic">written between ruled

roundness (see p.

<p>They are very useful as <em class="italic">copy-book</em> hands (see
p.
<a href="#p070">70</a>), for though the smooth gradation of their

essential <em class="italic">roundness</em>,
<em class="italic">uprightness</em>, and <em class="italic">formality</em> afford
the finest training to the penman, and prevent him
from falling into an angular, slanting, or lax hand.
Their very great beauty, moreover, makes them
well worth practising, and even justifies their use
(in a modernised form) for special MSS., for the
more romantic books—such as poetry and “fairy
tales”—and generally where speed in writing <em class="italic">or
reading</em> is not essential.</p>

<p>With an eye trained and a hand disciplined by
the practice of an Irish or English Half-Uncial, or
a modified type, such as is given in fig.
<a href="#fig50">50</a>, the
penman may easily acquire some of the more
practical later “slanted-pen” types.</p>

<p>The use of the “slanted pen” generally produced
<em class="italic">stronger</em>, <em class="italic">narrower</em>, and <em class="italic">stiffer</em> letters. Its
effects are detailed in pp. <a href="#p043">43</a>–<a

may best be studied in the tenth-century example
(fig.
<a href="#fig172">172</a>—the letter forms are described on p.
<a href="#p416">416</a>).</p>

<p>In the Carlovingian MS.—which does not show
these effects in any marked degree—we may note
the wide letter forms, the wide spacing, the long
stems (thickened above by additional strokes), the
slight slope of the letters, and the general effect of
gracefulness and freedom (see fig.
<a href="#fig171">171</a>). Carlovingian
MSS. may be said to represent a sort of
mediæval <em class="italic">copy-books</em>, and their far-reaching influence
on writing makes them of great interest to the
modern penman, who would, moreover, find one
of these hands an excellent model for a free
“formal hand.”</p>

<p>For practical purposes the “slanted-pen” letter

The “slanted-pen” letters have greater strength

Their use saves both space and time, as they

<p>The real importance to us of these early types
<span class="xxpn" id="p310"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p310]</a></span> lies, I think, in their
relation to the Roman Small-Letter (pp. <a href="#p418">418</a>–<a
href="#p419">19</a> &#38; <a href="#p429">429</a>–<a href="#p483">83</a>), and
their great possibilities of development into modern formal hands
approaching the “Roman” type.</p>

<h4 title="ROMAN SMALL-LETTERS">
ROMAN SMALL-LETTERS<span class="h4desc">
Ex.: (Italian) Plates <a href="#plate19">XIX.</a>, <a href="#plate20">XX.</a> (15th century);

<a href="#fig175">175</a>, <a href="#fig176">176</a> (16th century): figs.
<a href="#fig147">147</a>, <a href="#fig148">148</a>
(<em class="italic">modern MS.</em>).</span></h4>

<p>The <em class="italic">Roman Small-Letter</em> is the universally recognised
type in which the majority of books and
papers are printed. Its form has been in use for over
400 years (without essential alteration) and as far as
we are concerned it may be regarded as permanent.</p>

<p>And it is the object of the scribe or letter-maker
gradually to attain a fine, personal formal hand,
assimilating to the Roman Small-Letter; a hand
against the familiar and present form of which no
allegations of unreadableness can be raised, and a
hand having a beauty and character now absent or
<em class="italic">un</em>familiar. The related <em class="italic">Italic</em> will be mastered for
formal MS. work (p.
<a href="#p315">315</a>), and the ordinary handwriting
improved (p.
<a href="#p323">323</a>). These three hands
point the advance of the practical, modern scribe.</p>

<p>The Roman Small-Letter is essentially a pen
form (and preferably a “slanted-pen” form; p.
<a href="#p305">305</a>), and we would do well to follow its natural development
<em class="italic">from the Roman Capital</em>—<em class="italic">through Round
Letters and Slanted-Pen forms</em>—so that we may arrive
at a truly developed and characteristic type, suitable
for any formal manuscript work and full of suggestions
for printers and letter-craftsmen generally.</p>

<p>A finished form, such as that in <a href="#plate20">Plate XX.</a>—or
even that of fig.
<a href="#fig175">175</a>—would present many
<span class="xxpn" id="p311"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p311]</a></span>
difficulties to the unpractised scribe, and one who so
began would be apt to remain a mere copyist, more
or less unconscious of the vitality and character of
the letter. An earlier type of letter—such as that
in <a href="#plate08">Plate VIII.</a>—enables the scribe to combine speed
with accuracy, and fits him at length to deal with
the letters that represent the latest and most formal
development of penmanship.</p>

<p>And in this connection, beware of practising
with a fine nib, which tends to inaccuracy and the
substitution of prettiness for character. Stick to
definite pen strokes, and preserve the definite shapes
and the uniformity of the serifs (p.
<a href="#p324">324</a>): if these
be made clumsily, they become clumsy lumps. It
may be impossible always to ascertain the exact
forms—especially of terminals and finishing strokes—for
the practised scribe has attained a great uniformity
and some <em class="italic">sleight of hand</em> which cannot be
deliberately copied. But—whatever the exact
forms—we may be sure that in the best hands they
are produced by uniform and proper pen strokes.</p>

<p>The lines of writing are generally widely spaced—allowing
for the long stems: the <em class="italic">bodies</em> of the
letters being narrow are generally rather closely
packed, and frequently the lines of writing appear
<span class="xxpn" id="p315"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p315]</a></span>
as almost continuous light but compact writing,
while the <em class="italic">ascenders</em> and <em class="italic">descenders</em> and parts of the
Capitals may be flourished freely in the spaces between
the lines—sometimes filling them with ornamental
pen work, which contrasts strongly with
the extreme plainness and regularity of the
<em class="italic">bodies</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Italic Capitals</em> are a variety of the Roman Capitals,
slightly sloped (frequently less sloped than the
accompanying small-letters), and sometimes much
flourished (fig.
<a href="#fig177">177</a>). The types modelled on the
latter were called by printers in the seventeenth
century, “Swash Letters.”</p>

<p>In MSS. when it is not desirable to alter the
character, Red Writing (see p.
<a href="#p130">130</a>) may be substituted
for italics. Italics—either in black or red—go
best with “Roman” characters.</p>

<p>Like the Roman Small-Letter, the Italic is a
generally recognised and accepted form: this and
other considerations, such as the peculiar elegance
and charm of the letters, their formal relation to
modern handwriting, their compactness and
economy of space in the line, and the fact that
they may be written easily and with extreme
regularity—<em class="italic">being indeed the most rapid of formal
hands</em>—are practical reasons for a careful study
of the type, and justify the writing of certain
MS. books entirely in Italics.

<p><em class="italic">Character of the Writing.</em>—The good shapes of
the letters, their great uniformity, and their easy
yet formal arrangement, mark this MS. as the work
of a skilful penman. But, while pen character of
a sort is very evident, the writing approaches the
<em class="italic">stylographic</em> (apparently a rather narrow blunt nib
was used), and the absence of definite <em class="italic">thicks</em> and
thins distinguishes it from all the formal hands
hitherto discussed: it may conveniently be termed
<em class="italic">Semi-formal</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Construction.</em>—The rapidity and uniformity of
this writing are largely due to an extremely easy
zigzag movement of the pen, such as is natural
in writing <em class="italic">m</em>, <em class="italic">n</em>, and <em class="italic">u</em>—the final upstroke usually
running on into the next letter. Note particularly
that the round letters <em class="italic">c</em>, <em class="italic">d</em>, <em class="italic">e</em>, <em class="italic">g</em>, <em class="italic">o</em>, <em class="italic">q</em> generally begin
with a nearly straight down stroke—like the first
part of <em class="italic">u</em>—to which tops are <em class="italic">added</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig182">182</a>).
In the case of <em class="italic">a</em>, the first stroke curves forward to
meet the second.
<span class="xxpn" id="p322"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p322]</a></span></p>

<div class="figc-s2" id="fig182">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 182.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>In the straight-stemmed capitals B, D, E, F, H,
I, L, M, N, P, R, and T, the first stroke is made
rather like an
<img class="letter2" src="images/i322c1.jpg"
width="45" height="90" alt="L" />
(showing the tendency to a zigzag)
the foot of which is generally crossed horizontally
by a second stroke making a form resembling
<img class="letter2" src="images/i322c2.jpg"
width="45" height="90" alt="I" />—on
this as a base, the rest of the letter is formed
(see fig.
<a href="#fig182">182</a>). This tends to preserve the uniformity
of the letters: and gives a fine constructive effect,
as, for example, in the letter
<img class="letter2" src="images/i322c3.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="N" />.</p>

<p><em class="italic">General Remarks.</em>—The semi-formal nature of
such a MS. would seem to permit of a good quill—not
necessarily sharp—being used with the utmost
freedom and all reasonable personal <em class="italic">sleight of hand</em>;
of soft tinted inks—such as browns and brown-reds;
of an <em class="italic">un</em>-ruled page (<em class="italic">a pattern page ruled dark,
being laid under the writing paper, will, by showing
through, keep the writing sufficiently straight</em>), and of a
minimum of precision in the arrangement of the
text. And in this freedom and informality lie the
reasons for and against the use of such a hand.
There is a danger of its becoming more informal
and degenerating because it lacks the effect of the
true pen in preserving
form.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> But, on the other
hand, it combines great rapidity and freedom with
beauty and legibility: few printed books could
compete in charm with this old “catalogue,”
which took the scribe but little longer to write
than we might take in <em class="italic">scribbling</em> it.</p>

<p>Many uses for such a hand will suggest themselves.
Semi-formal documents which require to
<span class="xxpn" id="p323"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p323]</a></span>
be neatly written out, and Books and Records of
which only one or two copies are required, and
even Books which are worthy to be—but never
are—printed, might, at a comparatively low cost,
be preserved in this legible and beautiful form.</p>

<p>It suggests possibilities for an improvement in
the ordinary present-day handwriting—a thing
much to be desired, and one of the most practical
benefits of the study of calligraphy. The practical
scribe, at any rate, will prove the advantages of
being a good all-round penman.</p>

<h4>OF FORMAL WRITING GENERALLY</h4>

<p><em class="italic">On Copying a Hand.</em>—Our intentions being right
(viz. to make our work essentially readable) and
our actions being expedient (viz. to select and copy
the simple forms which have remained essentially
the same, leaving the complex forms which have
passed out of use—see pp. <a href="#p195">195</a>–<a href="#p196">6</a>), we need not vex
ourselves with the question of
“lawfulness.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>Where beautiful character is the natural product
of a tool, any person may at any time give such
character to a useful form, and as at this time a
properly cut and handled pen will produce letters
resembling those of the early MSS., we may take
as models <em class="italic">such early, simple pen-forms as have remained
essentially the
same</em>,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> and copy them as closely
as we <em class="italic">can</em> while keeping them exact and formal.</p>

<p>Finally, <em class="italic">personal quality</em> is essential to perfect
workmanship, but that is the natural and gradual—sometimes
<span class="xxpn" id="p324"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p324]</a></span>
scarcely visible—departure from a model,
that comes of practice and time.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Forms of Letters: component pen-strokes.</em>—In a good
hand the chief component strokes—stems, bows,
and serifs—are repeated again and again (see pp.
<a href="#p244">244</a>,
<a href="#p254">254</a>)—this is essential to the uniform character
and the quickness of the writing. When substituting
a <em class="italic">new</em> for an <em class="italic">old</em> letter a naturally used
pen will produce such common pen-strokes, giving
the desired “family likeness” to the new
letter<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>
(<em class="italic">b</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig183">183</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Proportion<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
of Thick Strokes.</em>—The broader the
thick stroke is in proportion to the height of a
letter, the more the form of the letter is controlled
and affected by the pen (<em class="italic">c</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig183">183</a>). For training
and practice, therefore, the wide nib is the most
useful. A narrower nib (<em class="italic">d</em> or <em class="italic">e</em>) allows of more
freedom and variety, and there is a great charm in
slender lettering—this the trained scribe may essay
(see <a href="#plate20">Plate XX.</a>, and p.
<a href="#p482">482</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1a" id="fig183">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">

</div></div>

<p><em class="italic">Proportion<a href="#footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a>
of Stem Height.</em>—The character of a
writing depends very much on whether the stems
are <em class="italic">short</em>, <em class="italic">medium</em>, or
<em class="italic">long</em>. The stems of <em class="bold">b</em> and <em class="bold">p</em>
may be as short as half the height of the bodies
(<em class="italic">f</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig183">183</a>); a <em class="italic">medium</em> stem for ordinary use might
be two-thirds of, or equal to, the height of the
body (<em class="italic">g</em>). Stems may be drawn out to almost any
<span class="xxpn" id="p326"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p326]</a></span>
length, and may constitute a decorative feature of
the writing, as in the
Anglo-Saxon<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> MS., <a href="#plate09">Plate
IX.</a> (See p. <a href="#p331">331</a>, and fig.
<a href="#fig188">188</a>.)</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig184">
<img src="images/i326.jpg" width="600" height="686" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 184.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Distinct Lines of Writing.</em>—The line—especially
in MS. books—is really a more important unit than
<span class="xxpn" id="p327"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p327]</a></span>
the page; and the whole question of the arrangement
of Lettering hinges on the right treatment of
the lines. One is particularly struck by the distinctness
of the lines of writing in the old MSS.,
due mainly <span class="nowrap">to—</span></p>

<p>(a) <em class="italic">The binding together of the letters in the line</em>—<em class="italic">commonly
by strong serifs or heavy “shoulders” and
“feet”</em> (see figs.
<a href="#fig11">11</a>, <a href="#fig184">184</a>, and p.
<a href="#p414">414</a>).</p>

<p>(b) <em class="italic">Packing the letters well together</em> (see pp. <a href="#p077">77</a>,
<a href="#p262">262</a>).</p>

<p>(c) <em class="italic">Spacing the lines sufficiently apart</em> (see pp.
<a href="#p262">262</a>–<a href="#p265">265</a>).</p>

<p>It is a good rule (especially when practising) to
space the lines fairly widely. Really fine writing
shows generally to greater advantage if not too
much crowded, and there is more danger of making
reading hard by crowding the lines, than by crowding
the words (see fig.
<a href="#fig156">156</a>).</p>

<p>Whatever mode of treatment be followed, each
line should be written with as much freedom as
possible, the simplest straightforward writing being
preferable to that which is over-arranged.</p>

<h4>DECORATIVE CONTRASTS</h4>

<p>The decorative treatment of lettering generally
involves contrasts of <em class="italic">size</em>, <em class="italic">weight</em>, <em class="italic">colour</em>, or <em class="italic">form</em>—that
is, of large and small, heavy and light, variously
coloured, or variously shaped letters. As a general
rule, marked contrasts are best; a slight contrast
may fail of its effect and yet be sufficiently noticeable
to give an unpleasant appearance of irregularity.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Contrasts of Colour</em> (see pp. <a href="#p144">144</a>,
<a href="#p180">180</a>).—Note that,
while it is convenient to distinguish “colour”—as
<em class="italic">red</em>, <em class="italic">blue</em>, <em class="italic">green</em>, &#38;c.—weight strictly involves
<span class="xxpn" id="p328"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p328]</a></span>
<em class="italic">colour</em>: built-up or heavy letters in black show
extra <em class="italic">black</em> beside lighter writing, while the latter
appears <em class="italic">grey</em> in comparison (see figs.
<a href="#fig197">197</a>, <a href="#fig186">186</a>); in
red writing the heavy letters appear <em class="italic">red</em>, the lighter
letters, <em class="italic">pink</em> (see fig.
<a href="#fig90">90</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Contrast of Size.</em>—The simplest decorative contrast
is that of
LARGE<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> letters with <span class="smcap">smaller</span>
letters (fig.
<a href="#fig185">185</a>); the strokes being of equal, or
nearly equal, weight, there is an harmonious evenness
of tone throughout. Where the large letters
are very much larger, their parts are made somewhat
heavier to keep their <em class="italic">apparent</em> “weight” approximately
equal (see p.
<a href="#p486">486</a>). This is one of the most
effective treatments for inscriptions generally (see
p. <a href="#p299">299</a>, and Plates <a href="#plate05">V.</a> and <a href="#plate24">XXIV.</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig185">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 185.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Contrasts of “weight” and size.</em>—In simple writing
these are obtained by using two sizes of pen—the
small, light letters being used for the bulk of the
<span class="xxpn" id="p329"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p329]</a></span>
text, the larger heavier letters being used for occasional
words or lines (or <em class="italic">vice versâ</em>). This is a very
effective simple treatment for MSS. (fig.
<a href="#fig186">186</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig186">
<img src="images/i329.jpg" width="600" height="657" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">

class="italic">See also fig.
<a href="#fig191">191</a>.</em>)</div>
</div>

<p>The occasional letters may be more decoratively
treated (see <em class="italic">Responses and Rubrics</em>, p.
<a href="#p345">345</a>) by introducing
the further contrasts of <em class="italic">colour</em> (p.
<a href="#p144">144</a>) or
form (p.
<a href="#p336">336</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p330"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p330]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Contrasts of form, “weight,” and size.</em>—These
are generally obtained by the use of large built-up
<span id="fsize1">C</span>apitals, together with a simple-written (or
ordinarily printed) text (fig.
<a href="#fig187">187</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig187">
<img src="images/i330.jpg" width="600" height="212" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 187.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A marked contrast usually being desirable, the
built-up capitals (especially if black) are kept quite
distinct from the rest of the text (see fig.
<a href="#fig197">197</a>): if
they are scattered among the other letters they are
apt to show like <em class="italic">blots</em> and give an appearance of
irregularity to the whole. As a rule, the effect is
improved by the use of red or another colour (see
figs.
<a href="#fig91">91</a>, <a href="#fig93">93</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Contrast of form</em>—for decorative purposes—is
usually combined with contrast of weight (<em class="italic">e.g.</em>
“Gothic,” <em class="italic">heavier</em>, p.
<a href="#p336">336</a>) or size (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> Capitals,

<p>To give ornament its true value we must <em class="italic">distinguish
between ordinary occasions when simplicity and
directness are required, and special occasions when elaboration
is desirable or necessary.</em></p>

<p>The best way to make ornamental letters is to
<span class="xxpn" id="p331"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p331]</a></span>
develop them from the simpler forms. Any plain
type may be decoratively treated for special purposes—some
part or parts of the letters usually being rationally
“exaggerated” (p.
<a href="#p252">252</a>). Free <em class="italic">stems</em>, “<em class="italic">branches</em>,”
<em class="italic">tails</em>, &#38;c., may be drawn out, and terminals or serifs
may be decorated or flourished (fig.
<a href="#fig203">203</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Built-Up Forms.</em>—Even greater license
(see fig.
<a href="#fig161">161</a>) is allowed in Built-Up Letters—as they are
less under the control of the tool (p.
<a href="#p292">292</a>)—and their natural
decorative development tends to produce a subordinate simple
line decoration beside or <em class="italic">upon</em> their
thicker parts (fig.
<a href="#fig189">189</a> &#38; p.
<a href="#pxxvi">26</a>). In MSS. the typical
built-up, ornamental form is the “Versal” (see Chap. VII.), which
developed—or degenerated—into the “Lombardic” (fig.
<a href="#fig01">1</a>). Here
again it is preferable to keep to the simpler form and to develop
a natural decorative treatment of it for ourselves.</p>

<p>“<em class="italic">Black Letter</em>” <em

in use as an ornamental letter (fig.

fifteenth-century writing of Northern Europe (<a href="#plate17">Plate XVII.</a>). A
better model may be found in the earlier and more lively forms of
twelfth and thirteenth century writing (fig.

<p>Rightly made, and used, it is one of the most
picturesque forms of lettering—and therefore of
ornament—and besides its ornamental value, there
is still in the popular fancy a halo of romance about
“black letter,” which may fairly be taken into
account. Its comparative illegibility, however,—due
mainly to the substitution of straight for curved
strokes—debars it from ordinary
use.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Though its
<span class="xxpn" id="p336"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p336]</a></span>
distinction in form and <em class="italic">colour</em> (p.
<a href="#p327">327</a>) from ordinary

not matter whether the words are easily read or not. For mottoes,
&#38;c., painted or carved on walls or furniture, and for ornamental
borders round tapestry hangings, tombs, book-covers, bowls, flagons,

Their <em class="italic">greater strength</em> may not at first be apparent in

<em class="italic">Variety.</em>—There is a variety both readable and beautiful

“<em class="italic">Bands</em>” and symmetrical or asymmetrical <em class="italic">groups</em>

By closing up the letters and the words one may generally
avoid “<em class="italic">rivers</em>,” or accidental spaces straggling through the text. The
presence of “rivers” is at once made evident by slanting the page and
looking along its surface, across the lines. Note, that whether the
<em class="italic">lines</em> be close or wide, the interspacing of the <em class="italic">Small-Letters</em> does
not vary very much.</p></div>

<em class="italic">Experiment.</em>—Cut out a piece of dark brown paper the
exact size of the body of the text in an entire page of this
Handbook, viz.
<span class="mixfract">5<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">16</span></span></span> inches by 3 inches, and lay it on the text:
the tone of the brown paper being much darker than that of
the print makes the margins appear wider.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="fnlabel">64</a>
Such inscriptions contrast favourably with that Nineteenth
Century style in which it was customary to make every letter
occupy the same space and look as much like its neighbour as
possible.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="footnote_65" href="#FNanchor_65" class="fnlabel">65</a>
<span class="smcap">Note.</span>—There is less danger of spoiling letters
by narrowing them than by widening, because the limits to the
<em class="italic">possible</em> narrowing of a letter are more obvious than the limits to
its <em class="italic">possible</em> widening. Further, when letters are widened there is a
tendency to thicken their parts and make them heavy and vulgar.</p></div>

I believe.</p></div>

<p><a id="footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="fnlabel">67</a>
It is interesting to note in this connection that the eye
seems to prefer looking upon the <em class="italic">tops</em> of things, and in reading, is
accustomed to run along the <em class="italic">tops</em> of the letters—not down one stroke
and up the next. This may suggest a further reason for smaller upper
parts, viz. the <em class="italic">concentration</em> of as much of the letter as possible in
the upper half.</p></div>

The extremely beautiful and finished B in the “Trajan
Alphabet” (<a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>) has the division a little higher, and a
marked enlargement of the lower part; until the letter-craftsman
can approach the perfection of its execution he will find
a simpler form more suitable for his “standard.” A curious
form, in which the top lobe has nearly or quite disappeared
(<em class="italic">comp. c</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig161">161</a>), is found in early Roman inscriptions. This
form (which may have helped to give us the useful small b) is
not suitable for a modern Capital, and would lack the <em class="italic">distinctiveness</em>
of B.</p></div>

J. C. Egbert in an “Introduction to the Study of Latin Inscriptions”
says, “<em class="italic">J was not specialised as a letter until
the 15th Century</em>.” It would seem that in early inscriptions
a tall <span class="fsize2 verta-mid">I</span> was frequently used for J
<em class="italic">between</em> vowels, and for I at the <em
class="italic">beginnings</em> of words: later, while the medial I
remained straight, the initial form was curved to the left and used
for both I and J; this <em class="italic">curved initial form</em>,
<span class="fsize2 verta-mid">J</span>, at length became identified with the
letter J.</p>

<p>Similarly, it appears that V was used for an initial, and U
for a medial; and later, the V form became identified with
the consonant.</p>

<p>In the words
<img class="letter1" src="images/i283c1.jpg"

in fig. <a href="#fig95">95</a>, the <em
class="italic">initial</em> I is curved like a J, while the
medial i’s are straight; the <em class="italic">initial</em>
V has a v form, while the medial V in
<em class="italic">nativ(itatis)</em> has a u form.</p></div>

Palæographers call them “majuscules” (= “large letters”),

It is convenient to use the term “<em class="italic">Italics</em>” for both
the cursive formal writing and the printing resembling it. <em class="italic">Italic
type</em> was first used in a “Virgil” printed by Aldus Manutius of Venice
in 1500. The type was then called “Venetian” or “Aldine.” It was
counterfeited almost immediately (in Germany and Holland it was called
“cursive”); Wynkin de Worde used it in 1524. It seems to have been
originally intended for printing entire Classics, but was afterwards
used to <em class="italic">distinguish</em> portions of the text (<em class="italic">see also</em> p.
<a href="#p373">373</a>).</p></div>

In English so many <em class="italic">ascending</em> and <em class="italic">descending</em> letters are used,
that it might be the best and most natural treatment of these

href="#p263">63</a>). Note, in this connection, that our <em class="bold">a b c</em>
has been developed as a Latin alphabet, and that the evenness
of Latin MS. is largely due to the infrequence of tailed letters.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

Where there is only a slight difference in size, the effect is
improved by using a different <em class="italic">form</em> or <em

therefore, and particularly for forming a good hand, the
earlier scripts are to be preferred (or the late <em class="italic">Italian</em>): even
twelfth-century “Gothic” writing is hardly readable enough
for “practical” purposes.</p></div></div>

<h4>MS. BOOKS, &#38;C.</h4>

<p>Books in the making—as compared with ordinary
inscriptions—are capable of great compression or
expansion, and may be said to have a quality of
<em class="italic">elasticity</em>. Nearly all other ordinary inscriptions are
<em class="italic">set inscriptions</em> (p.
<a href="#p350">350</a>), requiring a given number of
words to be set out in a given space. But in books,
while it is convenient that the treatment of the
text should conform generally to a chosen size of
page (p.
<a href="#p103">103</a>), the contents of the page may vary
according to the letter-form and the spacing (pp.
<a href="#p107">107</a>,
<a href="#p262">262</a>), and the number of the pages is not
definitely limited, so that another page, or a
<span class="xxpn" id="p342"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p342]</a></span>
number of additional pages, may always be taken
to complete the text.</p>

<p>The size of page, margin, and writing having
been settled (see Chap. VI.)—and the pages ruled—the
penman writes out the text with the utmost
freedom, not stopping to make fine calculations,
but leaving such spaces and lines, for Initials,
Headings, &#38;c., as his fancy and common-sense
dictate, and letting the text—or its divisions—smoothly
flow on from page to page till a natural
termination is reached. And if the terminal page
has only one or two lines on it, it is not necessary
to attempt a balance with the previous page—the
book or
chapter<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a>
ends just there, for the good
reason <em class="italic">that there is no more of it</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Colophons, Tail-pieces, &#38;c.</em> (see p.
<a href="#p142">142</a>), make a
pleasant finish, and may complete the page or not
as convenient.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Planning: Sections and Pages.</em>—Calculations of
the amount of text, of the number of sections or
pages required, and so on, are useful, and planning
the pages may be convenient—for example, one
or more of the verses of a poem, or a given number
of words, may be allotted to the page—provided
always that the scribe preserves his freedom, and
treats each case on its merits. If he think it most
suitable to devote a complete page to each paragraph,
he may do so in spite of its resulting in the
pages all being of different lengths.</p>

<p>The one general limitation which it is proper to
<span class="xxpn" id="p343"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p343]</a></span>
observe is that of the <em class="italic">Writing-line</em>—its
length<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a>
and
spacing—and to this may be added the desirability
of beginning the text of every page on the first or
<em class="italic">head</em>
line.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>
For most of us it is not practically
possible to do without the <em class="italic">aid</em> of the writing-lines—which
really lead, through uniformity, to greater
freedom—though a book written without
them<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
might be as beautiful as any ruled manuscript.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Marginal Lines.</em>—These, the terminals of the
writing-lines, are frequently made double, with
about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span>
inch between (see Plates <a href="#plate20">XX.</a> and
<a href="#plate15">XV.</a>).
On the left this space is utilised for marginal
capitals, or is left blank; on the right the <em class="italic">first</em>
line acts as a warning mark and the normal
termination of the text, the <em class="italic">second</em> as a barrier
beyond which the writing should not go. The
double lines, in being more obvious than single
lines, are also more effective in “straightening”
the page (p.
<a href="#p109">109</a>): presumably for this reason the
two upper and two lower <em class="italic">writing-lines</em> were often
ruled from edge to edge of the page (see <a href="#plate11">Plate XI.</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Ruling.</em>—Marginal and writing-lines, once ruled,
are to be left intact, and may be regarded as actual
component parts of the finished pages. They are
best made with a hard blunt point (p.
<a href="#p108">108</a>)—the
<em class="italic">furrows</em> so made give an interesting character,
almost a “texture,” to the smooth surface of the
page. But they may be ruled with a fine lead
pencil, or with a fine pen and faint black or
<span class="xxpn" id="p344"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p344]</a></span>
coloured inks. Inked or coloured lines, however,
are not generally written <em class="italic">upon</em> (see <em class="italic">footnote</em>, p.
<a href="#p305">305</a>),
but <em class="italic">between</em> (see Plates
<a href="#plate13">XIII.</a>, <a href="#plate17">XVII.</a>, <a href="#plate20">XX.</a>, &#38;c.).</p>

<div class="figc-s2" id="fig192">
<img src="images/i344.jpg" width="450" height="291" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 192.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Correcting Mistakes.</em>—A neatly made rather small
letter above and a “carat” below (as in ordinary
writing) may be used for an omission (fig.
<a href="#fig192">192</a>).
A superfluous letter may be neatly struck out.
Erasures are usually unsatisfactory, and a simple,
unostentatious correction, besides disarming criticism,
is in accordance with the proper freedom of
the craft (see p.
<a href="#p174">174</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Annotations, &#38;c.</em>, preferably in smaller <em class="italic">coloured</em>
writing, are very decorative in the broader margins
(pp. <a href="#p144">144</a>,
<a href="#p315">315</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Special Books.</em>—A MS. book is necessarily unique,
and some special or personal interest—either of the
craftsman (see p.
<a href="#p142">142</a>) or his “client”—inevitably
attaches to it. This may affect its size and form,
the treatment of the text, and the decoration and
construction generally (see p.
<a href="#p100">100</a>). Every legitimate
opportunity of adding to its individual
character should be taken by the scribe and
illuminator.
<span class="xxpn" id="p345"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p345]</a></span></p>

<p>Fig. <a href="#fig175">175</a> and <a href="#plate20">Plate XX.</a> are both taken from
private prayer books or psalters; in each the name
of the owner (e.g. “<em class="italic">Euanzelista famulo tuo</em>,” <a href="#plate20">Plate
XX.</a>) is frequently inserted. Plates <a href="#plate15">XV.</a> and
<a href="#plate22">XXII.</a> are also taken from specially commissioned
MSS., and many evidences of their ownership,
such as portraits or coats-of-arms, form part of the
decoration of such books.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Church Services, &#38;c.</em>—(For a special church or
person.) Church uses are so varied, that it is most
important to ascertain the custom, use, or taste of
the persons concerned—especially as to the order
of, and the introduction or omission of, certain
words, paragraphs, or parts, the colours used in the
text, the notation of the music—and the manner
in which the book will be used.</p>

<p>A service book for the use of a priest gives
prominence to the parts in which he is concerned—the
responses<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>
may be smaller, and different in
form or colour. The rubrics—in red (see pp. <a href="#p140">140</a>,
<a href="#p144">144</a>)—are kept quite distinct, and may form a very
decorative feature. For a private person the other
parts—such as are said by the congregation—might
be specially marked. In either case a certain
amount of planning—<em class="italic">e.g.</em> completing prayers, &#38;c.,
in an <em class="italic">opening</em>, to avoid turning over—may be
justified by its convenience to the reader. Should
very careful planning ever be required, a <em class="italic">pattern-book</em>
may be made, having the contents of each
page roughly indicated in it.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Wedding Service Books, &#38;c.</em>—The interest and
<span class="xxpn" id="p346"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p346]</a></span>
value is enhanced if the book is specially prepared—containing
the proper names and dates, and only
the special psalms, hymns, prayers, homilies, &#38;c.,
which will be used. Dated pages may be provided
at the end of the book for the signatures of the
“friends and neighbours” of the principals.</p>

<h4>BINDING MSS.</h4>

<p>MSS. should be bound without delay in order to
complete and protect them.</p>

<p>To bind books in stiff boards, in leather, requires
considerable practice and skill, but a very effective
<em class="italic">limp vellum cover</em> can be made by the scribe himself,
who, in binding his own books, will learn to think
of the binding <em class="italic">as a part of the book</em>, and to allow for
it in the writing and planning (see p.
<a href="#p106">106</a>).</p>

<p>The following
note<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>
on covering books in limp
vellum is specially contributed by Mr. Douglas
<span class="nowrap">Cockerell:—</span></p>

</div>

<p>“Cut four strips of stiff vellum
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
inch wide and about
four inches long. On these slips you will sew the sections
of your book.</p>

<p>“Add to your book a plain section at either
end;<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>
vellum for a vellum book, paper for a paper book.
Knock up the backs of the sections squarely, keeping
the heads level, and across the back mark with a soft
pencil guided by a square, lines to show the position of
the slips. The positions of the four slips should leave
the space between the slips the same as that between the
<span class="xxpn" id="p347"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p347]</a></span>
top slip and the head of the book; the
space between the bottom slip and the tail
should be a little longer than the spaces
between the slips. At about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
inch
from either end make an additional line
across the back for the “kettle” or
catch stitch. These lines will show
as dots on the back of single sections.
Each individual section should now
have at the back a dot at either end
for the kettle stitches, and four pairs
of dots
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
inch apart to show the position
of the slips, ten dots in all.</p>

<p>“To sew the book, fold the vellum
slips about
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch from one end and
bend to a right angle. Place your front
end-paper outside downwards, with the
back even with the edge of a table or
board, and place your folded slips with
their shorter ends under it. Then insert
your needle from the outside, at the head
“kettle stitch” mark, into the centre
of the section and bring it out at the
first band mark; put the slip in position
and reinsert your needle at the mark on
the other side of the slip, and so on to
the end of the section, coming out at the
tail kettle stitch. This should leave
your section with a
thread,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>
passing
alternately along the centre fold inside
and across the slips outside, with a
loose end hanging from the kettle stitch
mark where you began, and a thread
with the needle hanging from the other
kettle stitch mark (fig.
<a href="#fig193">193</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p348"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p348]</a></span></p></div>

</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lay on your next section and sew it in the same way
but in the reverse direction, tying up with the first loose
end when you come to it. Sew the whole book in the
same way, tying on a new needleful of thread as each is
exhausted, making practically a continuous thread going
backwards and forwards inside the sections and across the
slips from end to end of the book. Each succeeding
kettle stitch should be caught up by a loop (fig.
<a href="#fig194">194</a>),
and it is well to catch together the loose threads crossing
the slips.</p>

<p>“When the book is sewn, the back may be covered with
thin glue and lined with a piece of leather, but as this is
a little difficult to manage neatly, and as the book will
hold together without it, for a temporary binding the
sections may be left without glue.</p></div>

inch from these. Place your
book in the cover and mark the places where the slips
cross these lines. Make slits in the cover there, and lace
the slips through them (fig.
<a href="#fig196">196</a>), first putting a piece of
loose, toned paper inside the cover to prevent any marks

lace pieces of silk ribbon of good

<h4>BROADSIDES, WALL INSCRIPTIONS, &#38;C.</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Set Inscriptions.</em>—Ordinary inscriptions generally
consist of a given number of words to be set out in
<span class="xxpn" id="p351"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p351]</a></span>
a given space. Careful planning may sometimes
be required to fit in the words suitably, or
to adapt the lettering to the space. But setting-out
(p.
<a href="#p258">258</a>) becomes much simpler after a
little practice, and the good craftsman avoids over-planning.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Place of the Inscription.</em>—The actual space
for a wall inscription is commonly suggested by an
architectural feature—a stone, a panel, or a niche—of
the wall; but in choosing a suitable space for
a given inscription, or suitable lettering for a given
space, we must take into <span class="nowrap">account—</span></p>

<ul>
<li>1. <em class="italic">The office of the inscription.</em></li>

<li>2. <em class="italic">How it is to be read</em>—
<ul><li>(<em class="italic">a</em>) <em class="italic">“At a glance,” or</em></li>
<li>(<em class="italic">b</em>) <em class="italic">by close inspection</em>.</li>
</ul></li>

<li>3. <em class="italic">The distance from the reader.</em></li>

<li>4. <em class="italic">The lighting of the space.</em></li>

<li>5. <em class="italic">The character of the surroundings.</em></li>

<li>6. <em class="italic">Any special features.</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p><em class="italic">The Size of the Letters.</em>—The all-important question
of readableness may be settled thus: the inscription
having been planned suitably to fill the space,
one or two words are written or painted (the
exact size) on paper—smoked or otherwise coloured
if necessary to resemble the background.
This is stuck upon the chosen part of the wall,
and then viewed from the ordinary position of a
reader. When the inscription is high up, the <em class="italic">thin</em>
parts—especially the horizontals of the letters—must
be made extra thick to be seen properly from
below.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Margins.</em>—<em class="italic">Wide margins are only required for
comparatively small lettering which demands the close
<span class="xxpn" id="p352"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p352]</a></span>
attention of the
reader</em>,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>
and generally a set inscription
looks best if the lettering be comparatively
large—covering most of the given surface, and
leaving comparatively narrow margins. The frame
or moulding, or the natural <em class="italic">edge</em> or environment
of the circumscribed space, is very often sufficient
“margin” (see <a href="#plate24">Plate XXIV.</a>).</p>

<p>The margins vary, however, according to circumstances;
especially the foot margin, which
may be very narrow if all the space is required for
the lettering (see fig.
<a href="#fig211">211</a>), or very
large<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
if
there is plenty of space (see fig.
<a href="#fig210">210</a>). And,
as in special pages or <em class="italic">terminal pages</em> of books,
so in <em class="italic">single sheets</em>, <em class="italic">panels</em>, &#38;c., the “foot margin”
may show—as it really is—as <em class="italic">the space which
did not require to be filled</em>, and was therefore
“<em class="italic">left over</em>.”</p>

<p><em class="italic">Number of Different Types.</em>—While in a book of
many pages considerable diversity is allowed, it is
essential to the strength and dignity of a single
sheet or set inscription to limit the number of
types employed in it. Three or four ordinary
types will generally give sufficient variety, and if
it be necessary—as in notices and placards—that
<span class="smcap">Important Words</span> be put in <em class="italic">special</em> types to catch
the eye, let two—or at most three—special types
suffice, and let the remainder of the text be
as quiet and reserved as possible. “Display
Types” commonly defeat their object by being
<em class="italic">overdone</em>. A simple contrast is the most effective
(fig.
<a href="#fig197">197</a>).

<h4>ILLUMINATED ADDRESSES, &#38;C.</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Forms of Addresses, &#38;c.</em>—The writer should be
prepared to advise his “clients” on the form which
the address may take, on special features in its writing
and illuminating, and on its general treatment.</p>

<p>Ordinarily an Illuminated Address is prepared
either as a <em class="italic">Framed Parchment</em> (p.
<a href="#p356">356</a>), a <em class="italic">Parchment
Scroll</em>, or sheet (p.
<a href="#p356">356</a>), or a <em class="italic">small bound MS.</em> (<em class="italic">i.e.</em>
in book form: p.
<a href="#p357">357</a>).<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></p>

<p>The wording commonly consists of three parts:
the <span class="smcap">Heading</span> (usually the name of the addressee),
the <span class="smcap">Text</span> (usually divided into paragraphs), the
<span class="smcap">Signatures</span> (or a list of names) of the subscribers.</p>

<p>An address is commonly in the 1st or 3rd person,
and in case of any confusion of these, any slip of
the pen, or other oversight in the draft, the penman
<span class="xxpn" id="p354"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p354]</a></span>
should, if possible, call attention to it before the
document is put into permanent form.</p>

<p>A very convenient and agreeable style of “address”
is a formal letter, beginning “<em class="italic">Dear Mr.</em>
<span class="nowrap"><em class="italic">A——— B———</em>,”</span> and ending in the ordinary way. This
is a form which may be drawn up more simply, and
which reads more naturally, than the ordinary 1st
or 3rd personal statement.</p>

<p>An “address” is sometimes in the form of a
resolution passed by a public or private body or
committee. For municipal or other important
corporations, such an extract from their minutes,
neatly and “clerkly” written out on parchment,
and duly attested by the signatures of their “head”
and their secretary, and without ornament save
their seal—on a dependent ribbon—or their coat-of-arms,
or badge, would not only be the most
natural, but possibly the most dignified and effective
shape which might be given to the formal presentation
of their compliments.</p>

<p>An “address” accompanying a present is frequently
little more than a list of names with a brief
complimentary or explanatory statement. If possible
such an inscription should be written or
engraved on the article itself, or be specially
designed to accompany it. In some cases this
is very simple: when a volume, or set of volumes,
is given, the inscription may be written in the first
volume—or on a parchment which may be inserted—or
it may be prepared in book form, in a binding
to match. A silver or other ornament sometimes
has a little drawer provided to hold a narrow scroll
of names. A portrait may have an inscription on
the frame—or even in a corner of the picture—or
be accompanied by a simple, framed parchment.
<span class="xxpn" id="p355"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p355]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">Signatures.</em>—A neatly written out list of subscribers—especially
when their number is large—is
very convenient: it does not require individual
personal appointments, nor involve risks of damage
to the address. The actual signatures of subscribers,
however, are of greater interest and sentimental
value, and on such grounds are preferable
to a mere list of names.</p>

<p>To avoid risks (or with a view to incorporating
the signatures in the decorative scheme) the decoration,
gilding, &#38;c., may sometimes be deferred until
<em class="italic">after the signing of the address</em>.</p>

<p>When the exact number and the names of the
subscribers are known beforehand, lines may be
provided for their signatures, marked with letters
in alphabetical order (the proper number of lines
under each). This method solves any difficulty in
regard to <em class="italic">precedence</em> in signing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Ordinary signatures require about
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span>
inch
by 3 inches space each. If there are many they
may be conveniently arranged in two or more
columns, according to the space available.</p>

<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Directions for
Signing</em><a id="FNanchor_106" href="#footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>—
<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Edges of parchment not to project beyond desk or table, lest
they be creased.</em></li>
<li><em class="italic">Paper to be provided to cover the address, with</em>
<span class="smcapitals">FLAPS</span> <em class="italic">to raise when signing.</em></li>

<li><em class="italic">Clean</em>, <span class="smcapitals">ORDINARY</span> <em class="italic">pens to be provided, and pieces of

</ul>

<p id="p356"><em class="italic">Framed Parchments.</em>—The parchment may have—beyond
the top and foot margins—spare pieces
which (after the writing and illuminating is finished)
are bent over the ends, and glued to the back, of a
stout, white card, or millboard—covered with white
or light coloured paper. Or—extra margin being
allowed all round—the edges of the parchment are
cut into tags or “scallops,” and folded over an
ordinary canvas stretcher, and well tacked at the
back with small brads. The wedges are carefully
adjusted till the parchment lies flat.</p>

<p>A parchment glued to the surface of a millboard
is more convenient for framing, but has a less
natural surface, and is not so easily managed by
the penman as the plain, flexible parchment.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Frames</em> should be gold, black, or white; very
plain, and generally without mounts. The parchment,
however, must be framed so that there is no
danger of any part of it coming into contact with
the glass (as that, being damp, would lead to cockling).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Parchment Scroll.</em>—The foot edge of the parchment
may be folded over
twice,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>
a strong, silk
ribbon (see <em class="italic">footnote</em>, p.
<a href="#p350">350</a>) is laced along through
slits in the folded part (<em class="italic">a</em>, fig.
<a href="#fig198">198</a>), so that the two
ends come out again at the centre—where they
may be knotted together—and are ready to tie
round the scroll when it is rolled up (<em class="italic">b</em>). A rather
narrow, “<em class="italic">upright</em>” parchment is most convenient
(<em class="italic">c</em>). An “<em class="italic">oblong</em>” parchment may be very effectively
arranged in long lines of writing (<em class="italic">d</em>). If a
special casket or case is not provided, a neat
<span class="xxpn" id="p357"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p357]</a></span>
japanned tin case may be obtained for a few
shillings.</p>

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 198.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">A small Bound MS.</em> is certainly the most easily
handled form in which an address may be prepared—its
convenience to the penman, the signatories,
the reader, and the addressee, is strongly in its
favour. A lengthy address, or a very large number
of names, may be contained in a comparatively
small book.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Method of Planning out Addresses,
&#38;c.</em>—If in the <span class="xxpn" id="p358"><a class="noform"

form</em>, the address is treated much as an ordinary book (see
Chap. VI., and <em class="italic">Binding</em>, p.
<a href="#p346">346</a>). The <em

is planned similarly to a single sheet (p.

<p><em class="italic">General Remarks.</em>—The above simple
mode of planning out can be further simplified in custom and
practice. By the penman <em class="italic">keeping to regular
shapes, proportions,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#footnote_108"
class="fnanchor">108</a> and modes of treatment for
regular <span class="xxpn" id="p360"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p360]</a></span> occasions</em>, the
addresses, &#38;c., will practically “plan themselves” (p.
<a href="#p101">101</a>),
and better workmanship is the natural result.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig199">
<img src="images/i360.jpg" width="600" height="753" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 199.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Generally the simpler the form and the treatment
of an Illuminated Address, the better the effect.
The most effective decoration is the plain coloured
or gold capital, and the finest ornament is a coat-of-arms
(see “<em class="italic">Heraldry</em>,” below; and for general,
<span class="xxpn" id="p361"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p361]</a></span>
simple Illumination, see Chapters VII. to XIII.). A
symbolical mark, such as a crest, badge, monogram,
cypher, or other device (p.
<a href="#p362">362</a>), boldly and decoratively
treated, may be used in place of a coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>There is too much “Illumination” in the conventional
“Address,” which looks like a “<em class="italic">piece of
decoration</em>” <em class="italic">with a little writing</em>. A really reasonable
and effective Illuminated Address is <em class="italic">a piece of
writing suitably decorated</em>.</p>

<div class="tb">•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;•&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</div>

<p><em class="italic">Heraldry.</em>—A reliable handbook must be consulted,
for accurate “<em class="italic">blazoning</em>” is essential.
Early examples should be studied (see p.
<a href="#p387">387</a>).
The diagram, fig.
<a href="#fig199">199</a>, is given as an example of
how a charge was evenly arranged on the shield
(see <em class="italic">balanced</em> background, p.
<a href="#p419">419</a>). Another example—showing
a diapered chequer—is given on p.
<a href="#p336">336</a>.</p>

<p>Shields in <em class="italic">Illuminated</em> borders may be coloured
before the border, lest the brilliant mass of colour
of the shield clash with the border. The shield, if
large, may with advantage set the tone of the whole
colour scheme.</p>

<h4>MONOGRAMS &#38; DEVICES</h4>

<p>A <em class="italic">Monogram</em> consists of two or
more letters combined in one form, as the diphthong
<img class="letter3" src="images/i361c3.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="Æ" />,
and the amperzand<a id="FNanchor_109"
href="#footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
<img class="letter3" src="images/i361c1.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="amperzand" /> for
<img class="letter3" src="images/i361c2.jpg"
width="122" height="90" alt="amperzand" />:
its legibility may be helped by compound colouring. A <em
class="italic">Cypher</em> consists of linked or interlaced
letters, as
<img class="letter3" src="images/i361c6.jpg"
width="115" height="90" alt="linked circles" />,
<span class="xxpn" id="p362"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p362]</a></span> and may be repeated and
reversed if desired (see fig.
<a href="#fig200">200</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig200">
<img src="images/i362.jpg" width="600" height="768" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 200.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Monograms and cyphers may be very decoratively employed
as ornaments, and may be used to mark a man’s goods, or as
a <em class="italic">signature</em> on his work: something
easily recognized—either very legible or characteristic—is
therefore desirable. The two modes may be combined, and there
is no limit to <span class="xxpn" id="p363"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p363]</a></span> the effective devices
and ornaments which may be composed of letters. Simple and
straightforward devices, however, are generally preferable to
very ornate or intricate designs.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Chronograms.</em>—A chronogram consists of a word
or words in which the numerical letters indicate a
date. The following is from a very fine memorial
inscription at Rye (see fig. <span class="nowrap">207):—</span></p>

<p class="center">
 I<em class="italic">oannes Three</em>L<em class="italic">e</em> M<em class="italic">e</em>DI<em class="italic">o</em> L<em class="italic">ætæ ætat</em>I<em class="italic">s f</em>L<em class="italic">ore ob</em>II<em class="italic">t</em>.
</p>

<p>It expresses the date
I&#8201;+&#8201;L&#8201;+&#8201;M&#8201;+&#8201;D&#8201;+&#8201;I&#8201;+&#8201;L&#8201;+&#8201;I&#8201;+&#8201;L&#8201;+&#8201;I&#8201;+&#8201;I
(or
1&#8201;+&#8201;50&#8201;+&#8201;1000&#8201;+&#8201;500&#8201;+&#8201;1&#8201;+&#8201;50&#8201;+&#8201;1&#8201;+&#8201;50&#8201;+&#8201;1&#8201;+&#8201;1)&#8201;=&#8201;1655. As every letter having a numerical value (<em
class="italic">i.e.</em> C, D, I, (J), L, M, (U), V, (W), X) may
be counted, a proper chronogram is not easily composed.</p>

<p>The letter-craftsman will discover many ways of “playing”
with letters, and of expressing—or concealing—names and numbers
in other words, and he may take every liberty he chooses in
his private pleasure, provided it does not clash with public
convenience.</p>

<h4>TITLE PAGES</h4>

<p>If large capitals be used, the <em class="italic">Name
of the Book</em>, <em class="italic">the Author</em>, <em
class="italic">&#38;c.</em>, above; the <em class="italic">Name
of the Publisher</em>, <em class="italic">the Date</em>,
<em class="italic">&#38;c.</em>, below,<a id="FNanchor_110"
href="#footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> may together fill
the page. Ordinary capitals (as used in the text) leave a space
in the centre (see Title Page of this book): often pleasantly
filled by a small woodcut—a symbolical device, monogram, or
printer’s mark.</p>

<p>Generally, the fewer and simpler the types, the
better: though contrasts of size, form, or colour
<span class="xxpn" id="p364"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p364]</a></span>
(see p.
<a href="#p327">327</a>)—such as printing one or two words in
large <span class="fsize3">CAPITALS</span>, or in
<img class="letter3" src="images/i364c1.jpg"
width="202" height="90" alt="'Black', in Black Letter style" />
<img class="letter3" src="images/i364c2.jpg"
width="208" height="90" alt="'Letter', in Black Letter style" />
(p.
<a href="#p331">331</a>),
or part in red—may sometimes be used with good
effect. When the types are rather varied, single
or double <em class="italic">framing lines</em> (called “<em class="italic">rules</em>”) placed
round the page have the effect of binding the
whole together. The page may also be divided
into parts by transverse “rules”—these further
solidify it. Black rules are preferable to red (p.
<a href="#p144">144</a>): if they are double, the outer line may be
thicker than the
inner.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></p>

<p><em class="italic">Relation of Title Pages, &#38;c., to the Text.</em>—Generally
the practical part of the book is to be considered
and settled before the ornamental and the
decorated Title page conforms to the treatment of
the text pages, and should be clearly related to
them by the character of its letters or its ornaments.
Its margins (especially the top margin)
should be approximately the same as those of the
text pages, though framing borders may occupy
part of, or nearly all, the marginal space. Without
doubt the artless, ordinarily printed title page is
preferable to those specially designed “title pages”
that have little or no relation to the rest of the
book.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Wood Engraving</em> (see pp. <a href="#p365">365</a>,
<a href="#p371">371</a>).—Of all the
“processes,” wood engraving agrees best with
printing. The splendid effect of Title and Initial
pages engraved in wood may be seen in the books
of the Kelmscott Press. In early printing, woodcut
ornaments or borders were commonly used to
<span class="xxpn" id="p365"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p365]</a></span>
decorate the printed title page. An example of
this combined method—of which unfortunately
the greater part of the borders have to be left out—is
shown in fig.
<a href="#fig201">201</a> (from a 16th century
book).<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<p><em class="italic">Initial Pages and Openings.</em>—The claim of these
to decorative treatment should be considered (p.
<a href="#p128">128</a>). We generally look at the outside of a book
for the <em class="italic">title</em>—which should be clearly stamped on
the cover. But inside the book we look rather
for its <em class="italic">actual beginning</em> than for its name, and,
while something in the nature of the “sub-title”
might be used, it would be quite reasonable to
revive the ancient fashion—especially in the case
of MS. Books—of making the actual beginning
the most decorative part of the book. Or a very
fine effect may be obtained by the decoration of
the entire <em class="italic">initial opening</em>—the title on the <em class="italic">verso</em>
(left page), the beginning of the first chapter on
the <em class="italic">recto</em> (right page).</p>

<h4>LETTERING FOR REPRODUCTION</h4>

<p>Where it is possible, it is generally best to make
use of ordinary typography. A good fount of type
and a natural <em class="italic">setting-up</em> or arrangement of it, are
more effective than many special designs (see pp.
<a href="#p364">364</a>,
<a href="#p267">267</a>).</p>

<div class="figc-s2" id="fig201">
<img src="images/i366.jpg" width="474" height="800" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">

(<em class="italic">see <a href="#footnote_112">footnote</a></em>, p.
<a href="#p365">365</a>)
</div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Wood and Metal Engraving.</em>—If special forms or
arrangements of letters are required, for which type
is lacking or unsuited, they are best cut in wood or
<span class="xxpn" id="p367"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p367]</a></span>
metal. The engraver leaves the mark of his tool
and hand upon, and so gives character to, such
lettering; while, if he has some knowledge of
letters, he may give fresh beauty to their forms.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Zincotype Process</em> reproduces, either in <em class="italic">facsimile</em>
or on a reduced scale, the “design” made
by the craftsman in “black and white.” This it
does more or less exactly according to the pains
taken by the zincographer, the quality of the paper
employed, &#38;c. The literalness and facility of this
process, however, seem to have had a prejudicial
effect on the work of the designer. Unless he conscientiously
determines that his design shall stand
without “touching-up,” the knowledge that he
may blot out or trim a faulty line with white, that
he may fill out or finish a deficient stroke with
black, that he may work <em class="italic">large</em> and zincograph <em class="italic">small</em>,
is apt to result in carelessness combined with over-finishing—or
a sort of <em class="italic">perfection without character</em>.</p>

<p>If zincography be used, a strong, rather type-like
letter, or a built-up letter—arranged to give a
general effect of richness of mass, would appear
more natural than the doubtful “reproduction” of
delicate writing or fine
pen-lettering.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p><em class="italic">Etching.</em>—Calligraphy might be reproduced with
very fine effect, retaining its natural delicacy and
on a plane surface, if a process of etching writing
in facsimile were possible.</p>

<h4>PRINTING</h4>

<p>The general question of fine printing and its
relation to calligraphy can only be briefly referred
<span class="xxpn" id="p368"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p368]</a></span>
to here. A proper study of the art of typography
necessitates practice with a printing press, and probably
the help of a trained assistant.</p>

<p>To would-be printers, printers, and all interested
in typography, the easily acquired art of writing
may be commended as a practical introduction to
a better knowledge of letter forms and their decorative
possibilities.</p>

<p>In this connection I have quoted in the preface
(p.
<a href="#preface2">13</a>) some remarks on <em class="italic">Calligraphy</em> by Mr.
Cobden-Sanderson, who, again, referring to typography,
says—<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The passage from the Written Book to the Printed
Book was sudden and complete. Nor is it wonderful that
the earliest productions of the printing press are the most
beautiful, and that the history of its subsequent career is
but the history of its decadence. The Printer carried on
into Type the tradition of the Calligrapher and of the
Calligrapher at his best. As this tradition died out in
the distance, the craft of the Printer declined. It is the
function of the Calligrapher to revive and restore the
craft of the Printer to its original purity of intention and
accomplishment. The Printer must at the same time be
a Calligrapher, or in touch with him, and there must be
in association with the Printing Press a Scriptorium where
beautiful writing may be practised and the art of letter-designing
kept alive. And there is this further evidence
of the dependence of printing upon writing: the great
revival in printing which is taking place under our own
eyes, is the work of a Printer who before he was a Printer
was a Calligrapher and an Illuminator, <span class="letspace-a">WILLIAM
MORRIS.</span></p>

<p>“The whole duty of Typography, as of Calligraphy,
is to communicate to the imagination, without loss by the
<span class="xxpn" id="p369"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p369]</a></span>
way, the thought or image intended to be communicated
by the Author. And the whole duty of beautiful typography
is not to substitute for the beauty or interest of the
thing thought and intended to be conveyed by the symbol,
a beauty or interest of its own, but, on the one hand, to
win access for that communication by the clearness and
beauty of the vehicle, and on the other hand, to take
advantage of every pause or stage in that communication
to interpose some characteristic and restful beauty in its
own art.”</p></div>

<p><em class="italic">Early Printing</em> was in some points inferior in
technical excellence to the best modern typography.
But the best early printers used finer founts of
type and better proportions in the arrangement
and spacing of their printed pages; and it is now
generally agreed that early printed books are the
most beautiful. It would repay a modern printer
to endeavour to find out the real grounds for this
opinion, <em class="italic">the underlying principles</em> of the early work,
and, where possible, to put them into practice.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Freedom.</em>—The treatment or “planning” of early
printing—and generally of all pieces of lettering
which are most pleasing—is strongly marked by
<em class="italic">freedom</em>. This freedom of former times is frequently
referred to now as “spontaneity”—sometimes
it would seem to be implied that there was
a lawless irresponsibility in the early craftsman,
incompatible with modern conditions. True spontaneity,
however, seems to come from <em class="italic">working by
rule, but not being bound by it</em>.</p>

<p>For example, the old Herbal from which figs.
<a href="#fig135">135</a> to <a href="#fig141">141</a> are taken contains many woodcuts of
plants, &#38;c., devoting a complete page to each.
When a long explanation of a cut is required,
<em class="italic">a smaller type is used</em> (comp. figs.
<a href="#fig135">135</a> &#38; <a href="#fig138">138</a>); when
<span class="xxpn" id="p370"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p370]</a></span>
the explanation is very short, <em class="italic">it does not fill the page</em>.
This is a free and natural treatment of the greatest
convenience to the reader, for illustration and text
are always in juxtaposition. And though the size
of the type and the amount of the text are varied,
yet the uniform top margins, and the uniform
treatment and arrangement of the woodcuts, harmonise
the pages, and give to the whole book an
agreeable effect of freedom combined with method.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig202">

<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 202.</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>An old way of treating a text and its commentary
is indicated by the diagram (fig.
<a href="#fig202">202</a>). The
text is printed in large type, the commentary, in
smaller type, surrounds it; such portion of the
text being printed on each page as will allow sufficient
surrounding space for the accompanying
<span class="xxpn" id="p371"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p371]</a></span>
commentary on that portion. The proportions and
treatment of every page are uniform (note,
particularly, the uniformity of the upper parts of
the pages, five lines of commentary being allowed
to enclose the text, or bound it above, on every
page) with the exception that the height of the
text-column varies—one page having as few as
three lines of text to the column, another having
fifty-nine lines. This free treatment of the text
gives a charming variety to the pages.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Poetry.</em>—A broader and freer treatment is desirable
in the printing of poetry. The original lines
and the arrangement of the verses should be more
generally preserved. And though the opening
lines of a poem may sometimes be magnified by
printing them in capitals—which necessitate their
division—to sacrifice the naturally varying line to
the “even page” is questionable, and to destroy
the form of a poem <em class="italic">in order to compress it</em> is a
“typographical impertinence” (see p.
<a href="#p095">95</a>).</p>

<div>
<img src="images/i371-2.jpg" width="600" height="235" class="textexcerpt"
alt="DECORATION OF PRINT [@Maltese Cross] MUCH MAY BE DONE
BY ARRANGING IMPORTANT TEXT IN “ITS OWN” CAPITALS; OR BY THE
OCCASIONAL USE OF EXTRA LARGE CAPITALS." /></div>

<p>For special letters or ornaments, woodcuts are
best (see p.
<a href="#p364">364</a>). The early printers generally
had little, simple blocks of ornamental devices
which might be used separately, or be built up
into a frame border for a whole page—a simple
method and effective, if used reasonably.
<span class="xxpn" id="p372"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p372]</a></span></p>

<p>The judicious use of colour, especially of <em class="italic">red</em>
(see pp. <a href="#p127">127</a>,
<a href="#p144">144</a>), is very effective. The extra
printings required for additional colours may make
it worth while (in the case of limited editions) to
put in simple initials, paragraph marks, notes, &#38;c.,
<em class="italic">by hand</em> (see pp. <a href="#p194">194</a>,
<a href="#p113">113</a>). The earliest printed
books, being modelled on the MS. books, employed
such rubrication freely, in spaces specially left in the
text or in the margins. There are still great possibilities
in the hand decoration of printed books.</p>

<p>The following note on printing, reproduced here
by the permission of Mr. Emery Walker, appeared
in the <em class="italic">Introductory Notes</em> of the Catalogue of the
first exhibition of <em class="italic">The Arts and Crafts Exhibition
Society</em>, in 1888.</p>

<div class="vert2"></div>

<div id="p372quote">

<p class="center fsize4">“PRINTING</p>
<div class="vert1"></div>
<p>“Printing, in the only sense with which we are at
present concerned, differs from most if not from all the
arts and crafts represented in the Exhibition in being
comparatively modern. For although the Chinese took
impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries
before the wood-cutters of the Netherlands, by a
similar process, produced the block books, which were
the immediate predecessors of the true printed book, the
invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the
fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention
of the art of printing. And it is worth mention in
passing that, as an example of fine typography, the earliest
dated<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
book, the Gutenberg Bible of 1455, has never
<span class="xxpn" id="p373"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p373]</a></span>
been surpassed. Printing, then, for our purpose, may be
considered as the art of making books by means of movable
types. Now, as all books not primarily intended as
picture-books consist principally of types composed to
form letterpress, it is of the first importance that the letter
used should be fine in form; especially, as no more time
is occupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing
beautiful letters, than in the same operations with ugly
ones. So we find the fifteenth and early sixteenth
century printers, who were generally their own type-founders,
gave great attention to the forms of their types.
The designers of the letters used in the earliest books were
probably the scribes whose manuscripts the fifteenth-century
printed books so much resemble. Aldus of Venice
employed Francesco Francia of Bologna, goldsmith and
painter, to cut the punches for his celebrated italic letter.
Froben, the great Basle printer, got Holbein to design
ornaments for his press, and it is not unreasonable to
suppose that the painter may have drawn the models for
the noble Roman types we find in Froben’s books. With
the decadence in handwriting which became marked in
the sixteenth century, a corresponding change took place
in the types; the designers, no longer having beautiful
writing as a model and reference, introduced variations
arbitrarily. The types of the Elzevirs are regular and
neat, and in this respect modern, but they altogether lack
the spirit and originality that distinguish the early Roman
founts of Italy and Germany: Gothic characteristics
inherited from their mediæval predecessors. In the
seventeenth century type-founding began to be carried
on as a craft apart from that of the printer, and although
in this and the succeeding century many attempts were
made to improve the “face” (as the printing surface of
type is called), such examples as a rule reflect only too
clearly the growing debasement of the crafts of design.
Notable among these attempts were the founts cut by
William Caslon, who started in business in London as a
letter-founder in 1720, taking for his models the Elzevir
<span class="xxpn" id="p374"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p374]</a></span></p>

<div>
<img src="images/i374o.jpg" width="600" height="348" class="textexcerpt"
alt="types. From this time until the end of the century he and
his successors turned out many founts relatively admirable. But
at the end of the eighteenth century a revolution was made, and
the founders entirely abandoned the traditional forms of their
predecessors, and evolved the tasteless letters with which
nearly all the books published during the first sixty years of
the present century are printed, and which are still almost
universally used for newspapers and for Government publications.
Particularly objectionable forms are in everyday use in all
continental countries requiring Roman letter. (The last two
sentences are set in a type of this character.)" /></div>

<p>“In 1844 the Chiswick Press printed for Messrs.
Longmans ‘The Diary of Lady Willoughby,’ and revived
for this purpose one of Caslon’s founts. This was
an important step in the right direction, and its success
induced Messrs. Miller &#38; Richard of Edinburgh to engrave
a series of ‘old style’ founts, with one of which
this catalogue is printed. Most other type-founders now
cast similar type, and without doubt if their customers,
the printers, demanded it, they would expend some of
the energy and talent which now goes in cutting Japanese-American
and sham seventeenth-century monstrosities in
endeavouring to produce once more the restrained and
beautiful forms of the early printers, until the day when
the current handwriting may be elegant enough to be
again used as a model for the type-punch engraver.</p>

<p>“Next in importance to the type are the ornaments,
initial letters, and other decorations which can be printed
along with it. These, it is obvious, should always be
designed and engraved so as to harmonise with the printed
page regarded as a whole. Hence, illustrations drawn
only with reference to purely pictorial effects are entirely
out of place in a book, that is, if we desire seriously to
make it beautiful.</p>

<div class="vert1"></div>

<h4 id="p375">INSCRIPTIONS ON METAL, STONE, WOOD, &#38;C.</h4>

<p>As the material naturally modifies the shapes of
the letters cut or formed on its surface, and as the
object bearing the inscription affects their arrangement,
it is essential that the inscription cutter make
himself familiar with various stones, metals, woods,
&#38;c., with the various chisels and gravers which are
properly employed on them, and with fine inscriptions
or examples of good pieces of lettering (see
pp. <a href="#p388">388</a>,
<a href="#p237">237</a>).</p>

<p>A knowledge of penmanship will be found
useful, and the pen may be appealed to to decide
questions of abstract form in regard to letters
which have come from pen forms (<em class="italic">e.g.</em> Roman
Small-Letters, Italics, &#38;c.). And in this connection
it may be noted again that the “slanted-pen
forms” (pp. <a href="#p305">305</a>,
<a href="#p043">43</a>) are generally the most
practical.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Engraving on Metal.</em>—Letters incised in metal
may most nearly approach pen forms, as the fine
grain of the metal and the comparatively small
scale of the work allow of fine “thin strokes.”
The engraver, however, while following generally
the “thicks” and “thins” of the penman, allows
the metal and the tool and, to a large extent, his
own hand, to decide and characterise the precise
forms and their proportions.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Inscriptions in Stone</em> (see Chap. XVII., Plates
<a href="#plate01">I.</a>, <a href="#plate02">II.</a>, and
<a href="#plate24">XXIV.</a>, and pp. <a href="#p292">292</a>,
<a href="#p036">36</a>).—The grain
of stone does not generally allow of very fine thin
strokes, and the “thicks” and “thins” therefore
tend to differ much less than in pen-work. Their
origin, moreover, is much less easily traced to the
<em class="italic">tool</em>—<em class="italic">i.e.</em>
the chisel—and the difference was less in the
<span class="xxpn" id="p376"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p376]</a></span>
early inscriptions (see <a href="#plate02">Plate II.</a>) than we are now
accustomed to (see <a href="#plate24">Plate XXIV.</a>): perhaps it may
be explained as a fashion set by penmanship (see
p.
<a href="#p241">241</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Inscriptions on Wood</em> are frequently in relief (see
raised letters, p.
<a href="#p377">377</a>), matching the carved ornament.
Incised letters may be painted or gilded to
make them show more clearly.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Sign-Writing and Brush-Work.</em>—Inscriptions, such
as shop signs, notices, &#38;c., painted on wood or
stone, require—besides a practical knowledge of
materials—a considerable facility with the brush
or “pencil.” Directness and freedom of workmanship
are most
desirable.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<p>A suitable brush will make letters closely resembling
pen letters. But the pen <em class="italic">automatically</em>
makes letters with a uniform precision, which it
is neither desirable nor possible for the brush to
<em class="italic">imitate:</em> and greater skill is required to control
the brush, which in the hand of a good “Writer”
will be permitted to give its own distinct
character to the lettering (see also p. <a href="#p292">292</a>, and
fig.
<a href="#fig164">164</a>).</p>

<p>The brush is properly used for temporary inscriptions,
especially on the surface of painted wood
or stone, but, for more important work, <em class="italic">incising</em> or
<em class="italic">carving</em> (painted if desired) are to be preferred as
<span class="xxpn" id="p377"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p377]</a></span>
being more
permanent<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>
and preserving the original
form<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
of the lettering.</p>

</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Alphabets.</em>—For practical purposes the best letters
are the <em class="italic">Roman Capitals</em>, <em class="italic">Roman Small-Letters</em>, <em class="italic">and
Italics</em>. These are susceptible of very decorative
treatment without loss of legibility. And there
are many varieties of the pure Roman Capital
(see figs.
<a href="#fig203">203</a>–<a href="#fig207">207</a>), besides the “Gothicised”
Roman and the simple “Gothic” Capitals, which
are all essentially readable.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Different Sizes of Capitals</em> in inscriptions in wood,
stone, metal, &#38;c., are generally kept approximately
equal in “weight” (see p.
<a href="#p328">328</a>). <span class="smcap">Note.</span>—A downward
decrease in height of the letters is common
in early inscriptions (p.
<a href="#p410">410</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Incising</em> is generally the most simple, and therefore
the most natural, method for making an
ordinary inscription. The letters should be large
rather than small, and be deeply cut. Note, however,
an <em class="italic">incised</em> stamp or die produces an impression
in <em class="italic">relief</em> on clay, &#38;c. This may be seen in the
lettering on Roman pottery.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Raised Letters.</em>—From the earliest times letters
in relief (or <em class="italic">litteræ prominentes</em>) have been used for
special purposes. They are generally rather more
legible than the incised letters, and the difference

<p>It is quite possible to make a beautiful and characteristic
alphabet of equal-stroke letters, on the
lines of the so-called “Block Letter” but properly
proportioned and finished (such letters may be
<em class="italic">Raised</em>, or <em class="italic">Incised</em> or <em class="italic">Painted:</em> see <em class="italic">incised form</em>, p.
<a href="#p391">391</a>).</p>

<p>Raised letters, if exposed to wear or damage, may
be protected by being on a sunk panel or having a
raised frame or ornament. The background also
may be left in raised strips flush with the letters,
between the lines of the inscription.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Punctuation.</em>—In early inscriptions the words
were separated by points; in the more ancient
they are square shaped
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c1.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="block" />,
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c2.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="block" />,
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c3.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="block" />, in the
more elaborate, triangular
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c4.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="black triangle" />,
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c5.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="black triangle" />,
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c6.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="black triangle" />, sometimes
with curved-in sides
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c7.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="black triangle" />
(<a href="#plate01">Plate I</a>.). These
developed later into the ivy leaf
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c8.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="ivy leaf" />
<img class="letter3" src="images/i384c9.jpg"
width="83" height="90" alt="ivy leaf" />, or
“<em class="italic">hederæ distinguentes</em>.” Such points may be used
occasionally in modern work with fine effect, but
should seldom be used between every word, unless
the words are <em class="italic">necessarily</em> so close that distinguishing
marks are required.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Phrasing and Arrangement.</em>—An inscription may
be arranged in sentences or phrases, and occasionally,
by the use of larger letters, greater prominence is
given to a word or phrase (see figs.
<a href="#fig197">197</a>, <a href="#fig204">204</a>, <a href="#fig211">211</a>).
This method is particularly adapted to the nature
of a <em class="italic">set inscription</em> (p.
<a href="#p264">264</a>), and may help both its
readableness and its appearance, but it must be
borne in mind that to lay stress on any one statement
or word may pervert its meaning or attract
too much attention to it.</p>

<p>Any confusion of sense, or accidental word
(p.
<a href="#p259">259</a>) or phrase, <em class="italic">appearing in the setting-out</em> is
<span class="xxpn" id="p385"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p385]</a></span>
avoided, if possible, by a slight rearrangement of
the part, or, if necessary, of the whole inscription.
Great care is taken that the spelling is accurate: a
pocket dictionary should be carried.</p>

<p>Reading is further facilitated by avoiding, where
possible, the dividing of words at the ends of lines.
It may be observed that in the more ancient inscriptions
words were generally kept <em class="italic">entire</em>.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Exercises in letter form and arrangement</em>, more
profitable than mere paper “designing,” might be
devised by the craftsman. Inscriptions might be
cut—on a small scale—in gesso or chalk, or inscriptions
might be variously spaced and arranged
on a properly coloured surface—such as a drawing-board
covered with light or dark cloth—in letters
cut out of sheet-lead or card.</p>

This is recognised in the Sign-writing profession, where,
I understand, an applicant for work is sometimes given a blackboard
or a piece of American cloth, on which he writes out a
short inscription in “sharp white.” It is not necessary to
watch the writer; good, direct workmanship shows itself, and
also every hesitating stroke or fault, every patch or “touching-up”
or “going over,” is made evident.</p></div>

Letters &#38; Letters in Relief — The Sections of

<h4>TREATMENT &#38; ARRANGEMENT</h4>

<p class="first"><em class="italic">Treatment.</em>—Inscriptions are carved in stone for
many uses: for Foundation Stones and Public Inscriptions,
for Tombstones and Memorial Inscriptions,
for Mottos and Texts, for Names and Advertisements,
and each subject suggests its own treatment.</p>

<p>Names and Advertisements should be easily read,
and usually entirely unornamental. The Treatment
of Texts, Memorial Inscriptions, Foundation
Stones, &#38;c., may, according to the needs of the
case or the opportunities of the carver, be either
simple or elaborate.</p>

<p>Colour and Gold may be used both for the beauty
of them and, in places where there is little light, to
increase legibility.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Arrangement.</em>—There are two methods of arranging
Inscriptions: the “<em class="italic">Massed</em>” and the
<span class="xxpn" id="p390"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p390]</a></span>
“<em class="italic">Symmetrical</em>.” In the former the lines are very close
together, and approximately equal in length, and
form a mass. Absolute equality is quite unnecessary.
Where the lines are very long it is easy to
make them equal; but with lines of few words
it is very difficult, besides being derogatory to the
appearance of the Inscription. In the “<em class="italic">Symmetrical</em>”
Inscription the length of the lines may vary
considerably, and each line (often comprising a
distinct phrase or statement) is placed in the centre
of the Inscription space.</p>

<p>Short Inscriptions,such as those usually on Tombstones
or Foundation Stones, may well be arranged
in the “<em class="italic">Symmetrical</em>” way, but long Inscriptions
are better arranged in the “<em class="italic">Massed</em>” way, though,
sometimes, the two methods may be combined in
the same Inscription.</p>

<h4>THE THREE ALPHABETS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">The Roman Alphabet</em>, the alphabet chiefly in use
to-day, reached its highest development in Inscriptions
incised in stone (see <a href="#plate01">Plate I.</a>), and it became
absolutely suited to the material.</p>

<p>Besides ROMAN CAPITALS, it is necessary
that the letter-cutter should know how to carve
Roman
small-letters<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
(or “Lower case”) and <em class="italic">Italics</em>,
either of which may be more suitable than Capitals
for some Inscriptions.</p>

<p>Where great magnificence combined with great
legibility<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>
is required, use large Roman Capitals,
<span class="xxpn" id="p391"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p391]</a></span>
Incised or in Relief, with plenty of space between
the letters and the lines.</p>

<p>Where great legibility but less magnificence is
required, use “Roman Small-Letters” or “Italics,”
or Roman Capitals, either small, or close together,
or both.</p>

<p>All three Alphabets may be used together, as, for
instance, on a Tombstone, one might carve the
Name in Capitals and the rest of the Inscription in
Small-Letters, using Italics for difference.</p>

<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 209.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Beauty of Form</em> may safely be left to a right use
of the chisel, combined with a well-advised study
of the best examples of Inscriptions: such as that
on the Trajan Column (see Plates <a href="#plate01">I.</a>, <a href="#plate02">II.</a>) and
other Roman Inscriptions in the South Kensington
and British Museums, for Roman CAPITALS;
and sixteenth and seventeenth century tombstones,
for Roman small-letters and <em
class="italic">Italics</em>.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>
If the simple
<span class="xxpn" id="p392"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p392]</a></span>
elementary form of the letter be cut firmly and
directly, it will be found that the chisel will suggest
how that form may be made beautiful. This may
be shown, for example, by an attempt to carve a
quite simple Incised letter with no Serifs and with
all the strokes equally thick. In making the ends
of the strokes nice and clean it will be found that
there is a tendency to spread them into Serifs, and
the letter is at once, in some sort, beautified (see
fig.
<a href="#fig209">209</a>).</p>

<h4>SIZE &#38; SPACING</h4>

<p><em class="italic">Drawing out.</em>—Take paper and pencil, or what
you will, and write out the words of the Inscription
in Capitals, or small-letters (or both), without any
regard to scale or the shape of the space the Inscription
is to go in. The carver will then see easily
of what letters and words his Inscription is composed.
Next draw the shape of the Inscription
space (say to 1 inch or
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch scale), and in that
space set out the Inscription, either “<em class="italic">Massed</em>” or
“<em class="italic">Symmetrical</em>,” as has been decided. The drawing
should be neither scribbled nor elaborated. A
good plan is to cut the lead of the pencil to a
chisel shape. The natural <em class="italic">thicks and thins</em> of the
letters (see p.
<a href="#p044">44</a>) may then be produced easily
and quickly. The carver will thus be able, after
a little experience, to calculate quite easily what
size he will be able to carve his letters, what space
he will be able to leave between the lines, and
what margins he can
afford.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
<span class="xxpn" id="p393"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p393]</a></span></p>

<p><em class="italic">The Size of Lettering</em> depends on where it is to
go (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> outdoors or indoors, far away or near), the
material to be used, and the space at the carver’s
disposal.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Out of Doors</em> letters should not, as a rule, be less
than
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span></span> inch high, more if
possible.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p><em class="italic">Indoors</em> smaller lettering may be carved, but even
then 1 inch is quite small enough, and that only
in marble, slate, or the finest stones.</p>

<p>In such stones as <em class="italic">Ancaster</em> or <em class="italic">Ham-Hill</em> it is not
possible to carve good letters less than 3 inches high.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig210">
<img src="images/i393.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 210.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>More than one size of letter may be used in the
same Inscription to give emphasis to certain words,
thus: on a Foundation Stone the Date (see fig.
<a href="#fig210">210</a>),
<span class="xxpn" id="p394"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p394]</a></span>
and on a Tombstone the Name (see fig.
<a href="#fig211">211</a>), may
be made larger than the rest.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig211">
<img src="images/i394.jpg" width="600" height="448" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 211.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Spacing.</em>—Proper spacing is essential to a good
Inscription. As a general rule, Roman letters
should not be crowded together. Space should
be left between each, varying according to the
letters—a narrower space between two O’s, for
example, and, generally, a wider space between two
straight letters. The lines may be about the height
of the lettering apart (see <a href="#plate01">Plate I.</a>) or pretty close
together (see <a href="#plate24">Plate XXIV.</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">Margins.</em>—If the Inscription is to be carved in a
panel, the surrounding mouldings take the place of
margins, and the lettering may fill the panel (see
fig.
<a href="#fig211">211</a>). If any space be left, let it come, as it
<span class="xxpn" id="p395"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p395]</a></span>
naturally will, at the bottom. If the lettering is
not to be in a panel, the margins depend primarily
on what the carver can afford, and where the Inscription
is to go. Every case must be treated on
its own merits, but as a general rule one may say
that the bottom margin should be the widest and
the top margin the narrowest.</p>

<h4>THE MATERIAL</h4>

<p>The best quality a stone can have, from a letter-cutter’s
point of view, is fineness or closeness of
texture, combined with freedom from holes and
flints or occasional shells, and the letter-cutter
will do well to choose the stone himself, if possible,
having regard to this quality.</p>

<p>The following is a list of a few of the best stones
for outdoor and indoor <span class="nowrap">use:—</span></p>

<ul>
<li><em class="italic">Outdoors or Indoors.</em>
<ul>
<li>Portland.—Especially good for lettering on account of its
fineness and its excellent weathering qualities, for it not only
hardens on the surface, but also becomes quite white if exposed to
wind and rain, thus showing very clearly any differences of light
and shade.</li>
<li class="clearfix">
 <div class="p395float">Hoptonwood<br />Slate</div>
 <div class="p395floatopp">
 Fine and hard: good weathering qualities. Great delicacy may be
 attained in these.</div></li>
<li class="clearfix">
 <div class="p395float">Ancaster<br />Ham-Hill<br />Ketton</div>
 <div class="p395floatopp">Only suitable for large lettering.</div></li>
</ul></li>

<li><em class="italic">Indoors only.</em>
<ul>
<li class="clearfix">
 <div class="p395float">Clunch<br />Chalk</div>
 <div class="p395floatopp">Very fine and delicate
 work may be done in these.</div></li>
<li>Bath.—A cheap stone, and easily carved; but unsuitable for small
 lettering.</li>
<li>Marbles and Alabasters.—Excellent for Inscriptions indoors, but
 much colour or veining tends to confuse lettering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="p396">SETTING OUT</h4>

<p>The stone being ready for the setting out, <em class="italic">i.e.</em>
smoothed and cleaned, lines are ruled on it for the
lines of lettering and margins with a pencil or point.
If the Inscription is to be arranged “<em class="italic">Symmetrically</em>,”
a centre line is ruled from top to bottom.</p>

<p>The carver should rule and set out one line and
carve that before ruling another, as pencil marks are
liable to be rubbed off by the hand in
carving.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>In “<em class="italic">Setting Out</em>,” the spacing of the letters
is thought of rather than their forms. And though
the beginner may find careful drawing helpful, the
forms which may best be produced with the chisel
are found only by practice and experience (p.
<a href="#p399">399</a>).</p>

<h4>TOOLS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">The chisels</em> needed for simple work are flat chisels
of the following <span class="nowrap">sizes:—</span></p>

<ul class="inlinelist"><li><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span
 class="fdn">16</span></span> inch,</li>
<li><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">4</span></span> inch,</li>
<li><span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span> inch,</li>
<li><span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span> inch,</li>
<li>1 inch.</li>
</ul>

<p>The shanks should be about 7 inches long.</p>

<p>It will be found useful to keep a few “<em
class="italic">Bull-nosed</em>” chisels (see 7, fig.
<a href="#fig212">212</a>) for use
in cutting curves, and a few “<em class="italic">skewed</em>”
chisels (8, fig.
<a href="#fig212">212</a>) for use in cutting the background of Raised
letters, as a chisel of that shape is more easily used in a
corner.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig212">
<img src="images/i397.jpg" width="600" height="778" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 212.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>The chisels are either <em class="italic">Hammer-headed</em>
or <em class="italic">Mallet-headed</em>, or they may have
wooden handles <span class="xxpn" id="p397"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p397]</a></span> (see fig. <a
href="#fig212">212</a>, and pp. <a href="#p401">401</a>–<a
href="#p402">2</a>). The Hammer-headed are the most used,
and a good number should be procured. The best are made with
<em class="italic">cupped</em> ends, to prevent them from
slipping on the hammer (see 5, fig. <a href="#fig212">212</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p398"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p398]</a></span></p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig213">
<img src="images/i398.jpg" width="600" height="739" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 213.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><em class="italic">Temper and Sharpness.</em>—Above all things the
chisels must be of the right temper, and
sharp.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
They may be tempered by a smith or tool-maker—if
the craftsman can do it for himself, so much the
<span class="xxpn" id="p399"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p399]</a></span>
better. They are sharpened on a piece of <em class="italic">Grit-stone</em>
(hard York stone, for instance) with water. The
Temper of a chisel may be seen by the colour (blue
shows a soft or low-temper, straw colour a hard or
high temper), and felt by the way it rubs on the Grit-stone
(a hard tool will slide easily over the stone,
while a soft one will seem to stick or
cling).<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p><em class="italic">Mallets.</em>—A wooden mallet or <em class="italic">Mell</em>, a Zinc
mallet or <em class="italic">Dummy</em>, and an iron or steel hammer are
required (fig.
<a href="#fig213">213</a>).</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Mell</em> is made wholly of wood, and should,
for letter cutting, be about
<span class="mixfract">5<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches in diameter.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The Dummy</em> has a head of zinc and a wooden
handle. It should be about
<span class="mixfract">2<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inches in diameter.</p>

<p><em class="italic">The hammer</em> should be about the same size and
weight as the Dummy.</p>


<h4>A RIGHT USE OF THE CHISEL</h4>

<p>The workman must find out, for himself, how
best to use his tools. In the ordinary way, it is
best to hold the chisel at an angle of about 45° with
the surface of the stone—in the manner shown in
fig.
<a href="#fig214">214</a>—in cutting both straight stems and curves.
The chisel is held firmly (usually in the left hand,
with the little finger about an inch from the cutting
end of the chisel) and tapped rather than banged,
and lightly rather than heavily.</p>

<p>The best way to cut a letter is to start at the
extreme left-hand point of the bottom Serif, and,
working upwards, to cut the left side of the stroke
first. Then start similarly at the extreme right-hand
point of the bottom Serif, and cut the right
side of the stroke. Then finish the Serifs.
<span class="xxpn" id="p400"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p400]</a></span></p>

<p>When cutting a curve, cut the inside first (fig.
<a href="#fig214">214</a>), and start as near the narrowest part of the
curve as possible.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig214">
<img src="images/i400.jpg" width="600" height="736" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 214.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>In Incised letters unnecessary junctions of the
parts may be avoided (see fig.
<a href="#fig215">215</a>). Where they
are necessary, as in a capital E, or in a small <em class="bold">y</em>, cut
<span class="xxpn" id="p401"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p401]</a></span>
away from the junction or down on to it, rather
than towards it.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig215">
<img src="images/i401.jpg" width="600" height="731" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 215.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>The Mallet-headed and wooden-handled chisels
are used with the Mell for large work and for
cutting surfaces.
<span class="xxpn" id="p402"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p402]</a></span></p>

<p>The Hammer-headed chisels are used with the
hammer for ordinary work, and with the Dummy
for small and delicate work.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig216">
<img src="images/i402.jpg" width="600" height="764" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 216.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>A Mallet or Dummy is not used in carving
chalk, but the chisel is pushed; the right hand
doing the pushing, and the left hand guiding and
steadying the chisel (see fig.
<a href="#fig216">216</a>). If the chisel
<span class="xxpn" id="p403"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p403]</a></span>
were struck, the surface of the chalk would flake
off.</p>

<p>In cutting an Incised Inscription with the ordinary
“V” section (see fig.
<a href="#fig217">217</a>), use one size of
chisel throughout. The width of the chisel should
generally be about the width of the letter stem
required. More elaborate sections necessitate the
use of several sizes of chisels.</p>

<h4>INCISED LETTERS &#38; LETTERS IN RELIEF</h4>

<p>Inscriptions may be <em class="italic">Incised</em> or in <em class="italic">Relief</em>, that is,
sunk or
raised.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>
The <em class="italic">modus operandi</em> and the time
spent in carving the actual letters are the same in
either case, but whereas when the Incised letter is
carved there is nothing more to be done, after the
carving of the Raised letter there is still the stone
surrounding it (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> the background) to be dealt
with, and this may simply be carved
smooth,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
or,
if our imagination be strong enough, and our hand
have the cunning, it may become under the tool
a field of roses and lilies in which the letters are set.</p>

<p>Other things being equal, it becomes a question
of economy which form of lettering one will carve,
as the necessity of dealing with the background of
a Raised Inscription, while more than doubling the
opportunities of the carver, at least doubles the time
spent in carving.</p>

<p>Raised lettering will show out more clearly than
Incised lettering where there is little light.
<span class="xxpn" id="p404"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p404]</a></span></p>

<p>Roman Capitals are more adapted for carving in
Relief than are Roman small-letters or Italics, which
are directly derived from the pen.</p>

<div class="figc-s1" id="fig217">
<img src="images/i404.jpg" width="600" height="769" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 217.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Raised lettering is more allied to ordinary
carving, while Incised lettering may be thought
of as writing in stone.
<span class="xxpn" id="p405"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p405]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE SECTIONS OF LETTERS</h4>

<p><em class="italic">For Incised letters</em>, a “V” section (1, fig.
<a href="#fig217">217</a>) of
about 60° is best for regular use; deeper rather than
shallower. The letters may with
advantage be cut a little deeper
towards the Serifs (see fig.
<a href="#fig218">218</a>).</p>

<div class="figright isize5" id="fig218">
<img src="images/i405.jpg" width="190" height="201" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><span class="smcap">
<a class="noform" href="#pageindex">Fig. 218.</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Although the simple “V” section
is the most useful, other
sections may be used for large
letters (<em class="italic">i.e.</em> letters more than 6
inches high), or letters in a very
fine material (2 &#38; 3, fig.
<a href="#fig217">217</a>).</p>

<p>If the lettering is to be gilded,
and the stone will permit of it,
Section 4 (fig.
<a href="#fig217">217</a>) is a good one to use. Only
the curved part is to be Gilded, and not the small
bevelled sides.</p>

<p><em class="italic">For Raised letters</em>, the best and most useful section
is No. 5; the slightly bevelled sides tell as part
of the letter. Experience, and the weathering
conditions, will suggest the amount of Relief to be
given. For letters
<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">2</span></span></span> inch high, out of doors,
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">3</span><span class="fdn">16</span></span>
inch of relief is ample, and if there be good light
<span class="fract"><span class="fup">1</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span>
inch is enough. Excessive relief looks clumsy.</p>

<p>Sections Nos. 6 and 7 are suitable only for large
letters; and elaborate sections should as a rule be
used only for letters standing alone.</p>

<h4>WORKING <em class="italic">IN SITU</em></h4>

<p>If possible the carver should work <em class="italic">in situ</em>.
When that is
impracticable,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a>
he should consider
most carefully where his Inscription is to go.
<span class="xxpn" id="p406"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p406]</a></span></p>

<p>In an Inscription which is much above the eye
level, the letters may be narrower in proportion
to their height, and the horizontal strokes extra
thick to allow for foreshortening. (See also pp.
<a href="#p351">351</a>,
<a href="#p270">270</a>.)</p>

<p>The advantages of working <em class="italic">in situ</em> are great,
for by so doing the carver sees his job as he
works under the same conditions of light and
environment that it will finally be seen under, and
the work is more likely to become a part of the
place because it has grown there.</p>

<p>And it is good to carve an Inscription on the
actual wall of a fine building, and better still to
work in the inspiriting atmosphere of building in
progress, or to work in the open air where the
artificial notions of workshop or studio are dissipated
and the feeling of life and freedom gained.</p>

It should be clearly understood that legibility by no means

Whenever it is possible the carver should not be bound

<p class="first"><em class="italic">GENERAL NOTE.</em>—All the plates
are in <em class="italic">facsimile</em> as to size (or
<em class="italic">nearly so</em>, allowing for errors in
reproduction) except <a href="#plate01">I.</a>,
<a href="#plate02">II.</a>, <a href="#plate22">XXII.</a>, and
<a href="#plate24">XXIV.</a>, which had to
be <em class="italic">reduced</em>, and therefore only <em

class="smcap">Note.</span>—All the MSS. are on “Vellum” (see p.
<a href="#p173">173</a>). In order to get a better impression of the size and general
proportion of a MS., the student might reconstruct it—or at least
mark off the margins, text, &#38;c.—on paper, from the measurements
given. Or a sheet of paper might be cut to the size of the given page
or <em class="italic">opening</em>, with an aperture (in its proper
place) through which the plate might be viewed.</p>

<p>The plates are arranged in chronological order as
nearly as possible. They are intended briefly to illustrate
the <em class="italic">Development of the Formal Book Hands from the
Roman Capital</em> and <em class="italic">the General Development of the Illuminated
MS.</em>: I hope, moreover, that, fragmentary as they
are, they will prove usefully suggestive in regard to <em class="italic">the
Arrangement of Text and Lettering and Ornament</em>. The
wonderful effect of the colouring cannot be given here,
but, in any case, the illuminator should look at some
original MSS. Several of the MSS. from which the
plates are taken are exhibited in the British Museum.</p>

<p>WRITING.—A very beautiful pointed (slanted-pen)
Uncial. The “pointed” character of the letters, which

peculiar charm. Note the top of the P has a marked
angle, and the M and H, and even the O, have this
slightly or strongly.</p>

<p>(From a facsimile—part of Pl. XLVII.—in “Celtic
Ornaments from the Book of Kells,” by the Rev. Dr.
T. K. Abbott.)</p>

<p>THE LEAVES—which are cut down and much
damaged—measure 13 inches by 10 inches.</p>

<p>WRITING.—A beautiful and highly finished (approx.
straight pen) Half-Uncial (pp. <a href="#p040">40</a>,
<a href="#p304">304</a>), tending to ornamental
and fanciful forms whenever opportunity offered.
(Note the treatment of inde.)</p>

<p>ARRANGEMENT.—Long and short lines: wide
spacing.
<span class="xxpn" id="p414"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p414]</a></span></p>

<p>THE LETTERS combine extreme gracefulness
with an unusual appearance of strength. This is mainly
due to the ends of <em class="italic">all</em> the strokes being finished; the
thick strokes have large, triangular heads (p.
<a href="#p327">327</a>) on
the left, and bases broadened by an additional stroke
below on the right (thus
<img class="letter5" src="images/i414c1.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="solidus, thick" />).
And the horizontal thin
strokes are either finished with a triangular terminal (p.
<a href="#p246">246</a>), or run on into the next letter—<em class="italic">joining the letters
together</em>.</p>

<p>The extreme <em class="italic">roundness</em> of the letters is contributed to
by their being written between DOUBLE LINES (pp.
<a href="#p304">304</a>,
<a href="#p088">88</a>), the upper line of which tends to flatten the tops.</p>

<p>The pen not being quite “straight” (see <em class="italic">footnote</em>,
p.
<a href="#p304">304</a>), together with a tendency to <em class="italic">pull</em> the left
hand curves, gives a characteristic shape to the letters

src="images/i414c3.jpg" width="313" height="90"
alt="Half-Uncial E, Q, T" /></p>

<p>THE ILLUMINATION throughout the book is
most elaborate and beautiful. Each division has an
entire Initial page occupied with the first few letters.
The COLOURS were “<em class="italic">paled green</em>, <em class="italic">red</em>, <em class="italic">violet</em>, <em class="italic">and
yellow</em>, <em class="italic">intense black</em>, <em class="italic">and white</em>, <em class="italic">but no gold</em>”: see description
of Celtic MSS., p. <a href="#p040">40</a>, Bradley’s “Illuminated
Letters and Borders,” and also the Palæographical
Society’s 1st Series, Vol. II., Pl. 55–58, 88, 89.</p>

<p>This notable book may be taken as an example of the
marvellous possibilities of pen-work and complex colour-work
(see p.
<a href="#p216">216</a>).</p>

<p>In considering the value of the writing as a model,
it may be noted that its highly finished nature demands
practised skill on the part of the copyist, and that though
modern <em class="italic">Irish writing</em> (for which it would be an excellent
model) still employs

by
<span class="mixfract">9<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">7</span><span class="fdn">8</span></span></span> inches).</p>

<p>THE WRITING is an English—or rather <em class="italic">Anglo-Irish</em>—Half-Uncial,
written at Lindisfarne (<em class="italic">Holy I.</em>)
under Irish influence (p.
<a href="#p040">40</a>). ARRANGEMENT—two
columns of 24 lines—long and short—to the page
(note how <em class="bold">eis</em> is got into the fifth line): wide spacing.</p>

<p>The writing bears a strong resemblance to that of the
“Book of Kells,” but is generally much plainer; it is
also less graceful, being <em class="italic">heavier</em> and <em class="italic">wider</em> in proportion.
The “Book of Kells” O is a <em class="italic">circle</em>, while the “Durham
Book” O is considerably wider than its height, and all the
other letters are correspondingly wide. The RULING
in both books consists of double lines, ruled with a hard
point <em class="italic">on both sides of each leaf</em>.</p>

<p>THE ILLUMINATION also resembles that of
the “Book of Kells” (see <em class="italic">opposite</em>), but a small amount
of <em class="italic">gold</em> is employed in it. (See also Palæographical
Society’s 1st Series, Vol. II., Pl. 3–6, 22.)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The “Gloss,” or interlinear translation, is in
the Northumbrian dialect, and was put in in the tenth
century, more than 200 years after the book was written.</p>

<p>WRITING.—An extremely good, formal, “slanted-pen”
writing, having great freedom (note the very slight
<span class="xxpn" id="p416"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p416]</a></span>
slope forward) and simplicity. This type of letter may
be regarded as a link between the Half-Uncial and the
Roman Small-Letter (see p.

<p>THE RULING: <em class="italic">single</em> lines (see
<em class="italic">footnote</em>, p.
<a href="#p305">305</a>).</p>

<p>THE LETTERS show very strongly the effects of
the “slanted pen” (see pp. <a href="#p043">43</a>,
<a href="#p305">305</a>). Note the heavy
shoulders and feet in

to the MS. being a charter. Charter-hands are
generally more showy and less legible than Book-hands,

<p>WRITING.—This has all the qualities of good
writing (p.
<a href="#p239">239</a>) in a marked degree, and I consider
it, taken all round, the most perfect and satisfactory
penmanship which I have seen.</p>

<p>Its simplicity and distinctiveness are very marked, so
also are its character and freedom. There is an almost
entire absence of artificial finish—the terminals are natural
hooks, beaks and “feet” made with a fine sleight of hand
(p.
<a href="#p311">311</a>)—and its very great beauty of form is the natural
outcome of good traditions and eminently satisfactory
craftsmanship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Notes.</span>—The letters are very wide, and the <em class="italic">inside
shapes</em> differ considerably from those of the tenth-century
MS. (above)—with which, however, there is a considerable
affinity (see p.
<a href="#p416">416</a>).</p>

<p>The <em class="bold">f</em> is longer than the
<em class="bold">ſ</em>, the <em class="bold">g</em> has a very fine form
with a <em class="italic">closed</em> loop, the <em class="bold">r</em>

<em class="italic">straight</em>.</p>

<p>Small (Uncial) CAPITALS
<em class="bold fsize4">um</em>
follow the Versal;
the serifs on the S and E are made with dexterous movements
of the nib (p.
<a href="#p246">246</a>), and resemble those on the
Versal C. V and U are both used for the consonant (V).</p>

<p>There are very few VERSALS in this book: the C
shown is in red (which has been smudged).</p>

<p>The large “ILLUMINATED INITIALS” in
the book are in yellow, blue, and red, and appear to me
to be comparatively poor, at least, to fall short of the
perfection of the MS.</p>

<p>Of this writing, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson
(“Greek and Latin Palæography,” pp.
<a href="#p271">271</a>–<a href="#p272">2</a>)
<span class="nowrap">says:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The sense of grace of form which we perceive in the Lombardic
writing of Italy is maintained in that country in the
later writing of the new minuscule type, which assumes under
the pens of the most expert Italian scribes a very beautiful and
round even style. This style, though peculiarly Italian, extended
<span class="xxpn" id="p419"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p419]</a></span>
its influence abroad, especially to the south of France, and
became the model of Spanish writing at a later time. We
select a specimen from a very handsome MS. of Homilies of the
first half of the 12th century (<em class="italic">Pal. Soc.</em> ii. pl. 55), written in
bold letters of the best type, to which we shall find the scribes
of the fifteenth century reverting in order to obtain a model for
their MSS. of the Renaissance. The exactness with which the
writing is here executed is truly marvellous, and was only rivalled,
not surpassed, by the finished handiwork of its later imitators.</p>

<p>“It will of course be understood that this was not the only
style of hand that prevailed in Italy. Others of a much rougher
cast were also employed. But as a typical book-hand, which
was the parent of the hands in which the greater proportion of
carefully written MSS. of succeeding periods were written in
Italy, it is to be specially noticed.”</p>

<p>(P. <a href="#p284">284</a>)—“we give a specimen of a hand of the Italian Renaissance,
a revival of the style of the eleventh or twelfth century,
and a very successful imitation of a MS. of that period. It was
this practice, followed by the scribes of the Renaissance, of
reverting to that fine period of Italian writing (see p.
<a href="#p272">272</a>) to
find models for the exquisitely finished MSS. which they were
compelled to produce in order to satisfy the refined taste of
their day, that influenced the early printers of Italy in the
choice of their form of
type.”<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>(P. <a href="#p285">285</a>)—“in the comparatively small number of extant
literary MSS. of a later date than the close of the [fifteenth]
century it is noticeable that a large proportion of them are
written in the style of the book-hand of the Italian Renaissance—the
style which eventually superseded all others in the printing
press. The scribes of these late examples only followed
the taste of the day in preferring those clear and simple
characters to the rough letters of the native hands.”</p>

<p>THE WRITING is fairly legible, but approaches
Black Letter (p.
<a href="#p331">331</a>) too nearly to be of use to us for
ordinary purposes. Note the ornamental Semi-Rustic
Capitals in text. Note the RULING of the two head
lines and of the foot line is carried into the margin.</p>

<p>THE VERSALS.—The main interest lies in the
varied forms of the Versals, which are most beautifully
made in <em class="italic">red</em> and <em class="italic">green</em> alternately. There is one elaborate
<em class="italic">gold</em> initial in the book, and several Versals in blue and
white (<em class="italic">hollow</em>: see p.
<a href="#p208">208</a>).</p>

<p>The five
<img class="letter4" src="images/i420c1.jpg"
width="61" height="90" alt="Uncial D" />’s—and
the <em class="bold">D</em> in the text—on this page
(folio 85b) by no means exhaust the varieties of <em class="bold">D</em> alone,
and there are very many varieties of the forms of the
other letters. On some pages each line begins with a
small Versal, while the more important Initials are much
larger, varying in size and ornament.</p>

<p>THE CONSTRUCTION of the Versals is unusually
slender, curved, and gradated. A rather fine pen
seems to have been used (p.
<a href="#p292">292</a>), and though the letters
are upright, the natural tendency to slant the pen can be
detected in the thickening of the thin parts—<em class="italic">above</em>, on the
right, and <em class="italic">below</em>, on the left—giving the suspicion of a <em class="italic">tilt</em>
to the O.</p>

<p>The <em class="bold">O</em>-part of each
<img class="letter4" src="images/i420c2.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="Uncial D" />
was made first, and the tail
<img class="letter4" src="images/i420c3.jpg"
width="45" height="90" alt="tail" />
added. This is very obvious in the <em class="bold">D</em> in the text, where
a stem
<img class="letter4" src="images/i420c4.jpg"
width="45" height="90" alt="stem" />
was added to <em class="bold">O</em> to make <em class="bold">D</em>.</p>

<p>Note the <em class="italic">dots</em> inside the Versals, one above and one
below. Originally these may have been intended to
effect—or hide—the junction of the thin strokes, by a
twirl of the pen at the end of the first stroke and the
beginning of the second, thus
<img class="letter4" src="images/i420c5.jpg"
width="45" height="90" alt="twirl of pen" /><img
class="letter4" src="images/i420eb-6.jpg"
width="45" height="90" alt="twirl of pen" />.
Their use is very
common in Versal forms (see fig.
<a href="#fig189">189</a>), and besides being
decorative in the ordinary sense, they may be said to
<span class="xxpn" id="p421"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p421]</a></span>
strengthen the thin parts (much as the weakest part of
the loop in an old key was thickened for strength).</p>

<div class="tb"></div>

<p>Note the right-hand Bows of the
<img class="letter4" src="images/i420c1.jpg"
width="61" height="90" alt="Uncial D" />’s are made thinner,
as though the Rubricator had been afraid of running into
the text in making their last curves—such an expert,
however, may well have had a better reason for it.</p>

inch.)</p>

<p>THE WRITING is a not very legible “Gothic.”
The <em class="italic">zigzag</em> tendency exhibited, especially by the word
<em class="italic">niniuen</em> (Niniveh), second line, is unsuited for such <em class="italic">formal</em>
writing (see p.
<a href="#p484">484</a>). The rapid placing of the Heads of
the letters is such that they appear broken and partly detached
from the <em class="italic">stems</em>. The VERSALS are of a good
type.</p>

<p>THE INITIAL is a monogrammatic ET. The
arms of the round
<img class="letter4" src="images/i421c1.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="Uncial E" />
terminate in leaves folded back, its
form is <em class="italic">hollow</em> and <em class="italic">inwoven</em> (p.
<a href="#p208">208</a>), and gives rise to
foliage, which fills the interior—passing over the fish and
behind Jonah. Note also how the jaws of the fish are
interlaced, and how compactly <em class="italic">all</em> the parts are put
together.</p>

<p>The close application of the background to the <em class="italic">curves</em>
adds to the general compactness, and together with its
spacing from the <em class="italic">straight</em> front <em class="italic">balances</em> the masses
(p.
<a href="#p424">424</a>): it may be compared to the even spacing of
curved and straight strokes (see fig.
<a href="#fig53">53</a>). There is an
extension of the background to hold the fish’s tail.

<p>We may not, I think, attempt to imitate the complex
12th-century decoration of this initial (see p.
<a href="#p196">196</a>), but
the treatment of the <em class="italic">elements</em> of form and colour is very
suggestive, and the whole piece of lettering is characteristic

contractions.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries
the whole Bible, written in this fashion, was often small
enough to be carried in the pocket. Note the closed

lines; the 49 lines of writing lie between these, so that
in each case the <em class="italic">ascenders</em> touch the line above, and the
<em class="italic">descenders</em>, the line below. Note the double lines in the
Foot margin (see p.
<a href="#p343">343</a>).</p>

<p>VERSALS.—A very narrow type is used in the narrow margins: the

red and blue Versals.</p>

<p>THE ILLUMINATED INITIAL is “historiated”—<em class="italic">i.e.</em>
it contains a picture illustrating the text, viz.
a representation of S. John writing to the Seven Churches—purely
conventional forms, or rather symbols, for the
most part, are used and beautifully fitted into the available
space. The greater size and more careful drawing of
the human figure (the centre of interest) is characteristic
of a fine convention. The slope of the vellum page on
which S. John is writing, and even the manner in which
the quill is held, are such as would naturally be employed
by a scribe (see <em class="italic">frontispiece</em>, &#38; p.
<a href="#p067">67</a>).
<span class="xxpn" id="p424"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p424]</a></span></p>

<p>The <em class="italic">capitals</em> of the pillars mark the position of the
cross-bar of A. The top serif is carried up and forms
a bud, which gives rise to leaf-like flourishes; the free
thin stem runs down forming a grotesque, which gives out
a leaf-like tongue. In either case the object—in every
sense <em class="italic">recreative</em>—is a renewal of interest in the designed,
elongated, growth of the forms.</p>

<p>Note the curved thickening of A’s left stem ends
nearly level with the foot of the right stem. This gives
balance to the letter (see R, fig.
<a href="#fig81">81</a> &#38; A, fig.
<a href="#fig189">189</a>), and
preserves the <em class="italic">essential form</em>, which suffers no distortion by
the thinner continuation below.</p>

<p>Note the balancing of the background mass on the
<em class="italic">straight</em> and <em class="italic">curved</em> sides of the Initial (as in <a href="#plate12">Plate XII.</a>,
see above); also the extension and shape of the background
accompanying the drawn out parts of the letter.</p>

<p>Here again no natural work would come of a modern

<em class="italic"><a href="#plate14">PLATE XIV.</a>—Thirteenth-century Line-finishings: Pen-work.
(Psalter). Brit. Museum, Royal MS.
1. D. x.</em></h3>

<p>THE LINE-FINISHINGS (see p.
<a href="#p205">205</a>), of which
there are very many throughout the book, all in red or
blue pen-work, are very varied. Nine kinds are shown
in the plate (which represents about a quarter of a page),
and three others from the same MS. are given in figs.
<a href="#fig87">87</a> (<em class="italic">b</em>) and
<a href="#fig126">126</a> (<em class="italic">f</em>,
<em class="italic">g</em>).</p>

<p>The directions of the thick and thin strokes indicate
a pen held at right angles to its usual position (almost
“upside down,” in fact: see fig.
<a href="#fig126">126</a>, <em class="italic">g</em>), and the
penmanship exhibits great speed and lightness of hand—the
rapidity and skill are indeed quite remarkable (<em class="italic">e.g.</em>
in the Lion in the eighth line).</p>

<p>Note that, though the writing occasionally runs into
the margin, the line-finishings stop at the marginal-line.</p>

<p>The photograph shows red <em class="italic">dark</em> and blue <em class="italic">light</em>: <em class="italic">e.g.</em>
the Bird is red, the Lion and the Fish are blue. The
fifth Line-finishing is a red filigree with blue “berries”—it
can hardly be described as a “floral growth,” as the
“branching” is reversed: the rubricator gained speed and
uniformity by the simple repetition of the whorls all along
the line—the upper branches were probably put in afterwards,
and the “berries” were added later when he was
making the <em class="italic">blue</em> Line-finishings.</p>

<p>The more complex decoration (not shown in the plate)
in this MS. is inferior to the penmanship: the small
<em class="italic">background</em> Capitals with which the verses begin—presumably
put in by a different hand—are more pretentious,
and do not match the Line-finishings.</p>

<p><em class="italic">General Note.</em>—When a space occurs at the end of a
line of writing, it is often best to leave it, and in a plain
MS., if it be “well and truly” written, there is no objection
to varying lengths of line (see pp. <a href="#p263">263</a>,
<a href="#p371">371</a>). But
a book, such as a <em class="italic">Psalter</em>, divided into many short verses—in
which the last line usually falls short of the marginal
<span class="xxpn" id="p426"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p426]</a></span>
line—offers a fair field for such simple and effective
decoration. (See also pp. <a href="#p428">428</a>,
<a href="#p486">486</a>, fig.
<a href="#fig130">130</a>, and

<p>THE WRITING is a fine, freely formed, “Gothic”
(p.
<a href="#p331">331</a>). Note, the i’s are “dotted.” Note the double
MARGINAL LINES (p.
<a href="#p343">343</a>).</p>

<p>THE SMALL INITIALS are of the “Lombardic”
type (p.
<a href="#p210">210</a>), in which the Serifs are much thickened
and ornamented. Note the tails of the Q’s are turned to
the left to clear the writing. The LINE-FILLINGS
match the small initials (p.
<a href="#p193">193</a>).</p>

<p>THE LARGE INITIAL, &#38;c.—The plate shows the end of the
fourteenth and beginning of the fifteenth Psalm
(<img class="letter3" src="images/i426c.jpg"
width="216" height="90" alt="Domine" />
<img class="letter3" src="images/i426c-2.jpg"
width="88" height="90" alt="quis" />
<img class="letter3" src="images/i426c-3.jpg"
width="174" height="90" alt="habitabit" />).
Note “<em class="italic">Arabic</em>” numerals (15)
in margin.</p>

<p>The tail of the Initial
<img class="letter4" src="images/i420c1.jpg"
width="61" height="90" alt="Uncial D" />
is formed of a dragon, the
head of which rests on the O-part: its wings project into
the inner margin (and these in the plate, which shows a
fragment of a <em class="italic">verso</em> page, run into the fold between the
pages): the tail (together with the background) descends
till a convenient point is reached from which the lower
scroll-work springs. The tail, wing, and claws above,
belong to a magpie which is perched on the initial.</p>

<p>THE DRAWING: see reference to this at p. <a href="#p203">203</a>,
and below.</p>

<p>Sir Edward Maunde Thompson (p. <a href="#fig05">39</a>, “English
Illuminated MSS.”) says of <span class="nowrap">this—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“—the Additional MS. 24686 in the British Museum, known
as the Tenison Psalter, from its having once formed part of the
library of Archbishop Tenison. This psalter is one of the most
beautiful illuminated English manuscripts of its time, but unfortunately
only in part, for it was not finished in the perfect
<span class="xxpn" id="p427"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p427]</a></span>
style in which it was begun&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. in the first quire of the text
the ornamentation is of peculiar
beauty.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#footnote_133"
class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>“—the progress of the art [since the earlier part of the
thirteenth century]&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. is&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. manifest. There is more
freedom in the drawing, the stiffness of the earlier examples
is in great measure overcome; and the pendant has thrown out
a branch which has already put forth leaves. A great variety
of colours, blue, rose, vermilion, lake, green, brown, as well
as burnished gold, is employed in the composition of the large
initial and its accompanying pendant and border, and the small
initials are of gold laid on a ground of blue or lake, and filled
with lake or blue; while the ribbons which fill up the spaces
at the ends of the verses are alternately of the same colours and
are decorated with patterns in silver on the blue and in gold on
the lake.”</p>

<p>“The group of the dismounted knight
despatching<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#footnote_134"
class="fnanchor">134</a> a
gryphon, which has proved too much for the horse, upon
whose dying body the expectant raven has already perched,
is tinted in lighter colours. It is an instance of the use to
which marginal space was put, particularly by English artists,
for the introduction of little scenes, such as episodes in romances
or stories, games, grotesque combats, social scenes, &#38;c., often
drawn with a light free hand and most artistic touch. Without
these little sketches, much of the manners and customs, dress,
and daily life of our ancestors would have remained for ever
unknown to us.”</p></div>

27695), a <em class="italic">Latin</em> treatise on the Virtues and Vices (The

The marginal lines (from head to foot of the page) and
the writing lines are RULED in faint red.</p>

<p>THE WRITING is a late formal “Gothic”—the
thin strokes have evidently been added (p.
<a href="#p047">47</a>). The
written Capitals are blotted with yellow (see p.
<a href="#p140">140</a>).
The ILLUMINATED INITIAL Q is in blue,
white lined, on a gold ground, contains a blue flower and
five ornaments in “lake.” The LINE-FILLINGS
are in blue and “lake,” separated by a gold circle,
triangle, or lozenge.</p>

<p>THE FILIGREE ILLUMINATION springs
from the initial in the narrow margin, and from a <em class="italic">centre</em>
ornament (see “knot,” fig.
<a href="#fig127">127</a>) in the wide side margin.
The side margins are treated similarly on either page
(see p.
<a href="#p213">213</a>); the inner margins are generally plain.
This repetition gives to the pages a certain sameness—which
is a <em class="italic">characteristic</em> rather than a fault of the
treatment.</p>

<p>The border on the <em class="italic">recto</em> of the vellum leaf shows
through on the <em class="italic">verso</em> or back of the leaf. The main
lines of the first border, however, are freely traced and
<span class="xxpn" id="p429"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p429]</a></span>
followed on the <em class="italic">verso</em> (and so nearly hidden) by the
second border. This is also suggestive of the more
rapid methods of book production in the 15th century.</p>

<p>This type of illumination is discussed in pp. <a href="#p197">197</a>–<a
href="#p202">202</a>.
Its chief points are its simplicity and rapidity. A penman
or a novice in illuminating can, by taking a little pains,
beautify his MSS. easily and quickly; and he may perhaps
pass on from this to “higher” types of illumination.</p>

They are freely copied on a large scale in fig.

“Roman” forms with a slight “Gothic” tendency.
Both these and the Capitals would make very good
models for free Roman hands.</p>

<p>THE INITIAL is a “Roman” A in burnished
gold. Note the exceedingly graceful shaping of the
limbs, the ornamental, V-shaped cross-bar, and the
absence of serifs (see fig.

The interstices of the background are painted in blue,

NOTES ON THE PLATES
<span class="smaller">Plate XIX, Continued</span></h2>

<p>THE INITIAL A, its frame, the frame of the
border, and the “furred” <em class="italic">berries</em>
(<img class="letter5" src="images/i188c1.jpg" width="90"
height="90" alt="THEREFORE" />)
are all in burnished
gold, outlined black. The “white vine pattern”
is rather simpler, and has a rather thicker stalk (in proportion)
than that in the previous plate (see above). Its
treatment is very similar, but it may be noted that the
border is in this case attached to the Initial, and the
pattern has almost an appearance of springing from the
Initial. The pattern—save one escaped leaf—is straitly
confined, by gold bars, throughout the length of the text,
but at the ends it is branched out and beautifully flourished
in the free margins above and below. These terminals
of the pattern having a broad blue outline (dotted white)
may be said to carry their background with them.</p>

<p>The (recto) page opposite that shown in the plate has
an initial D and a border similarly treated, and each one
of the Psalms and Prayers throughout the book is begun
in like manner.</p>

<p>“From a book containing the Penitential Psalms in

Written with great delicacy by Mark of Vicenza for
some one named Evangelista [see 11th line] in the last
quarter of the fifteenth century. Other works of this

<span class="mixfract">1<span class="fract"><span
class="fup">13</span><span class="fdn">16</span></span></span> inch.</p>

<p>This very fine WRITING is typical of the practical
style and beautiful workmanship which should be the aim
of a modern scribe (see pp. <a href="#p047">47</a>,
<a href="#p310">310</a>).</p>

<p>It is written with a very narrow nib, hence the pen-forms
<span class="xxpn" id="p482"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p482]</a></span>
are not so obvious as in some early formal hands;
and for this reason alone it would be better to practise
such a hand as the tenth-century MS. (<a href="#plate08">Plate VIII.</a>)
before seriously attempting to model a hand on the above
(see pp. <a href="#p416">416</a>,
<a href="#p311">311</a>, <a href="#p324">324</a>).</p>

<p>The use of a fine pen is apt to flatter the unskilled
penman, and he finds it hard to distinguish between
delicate pen-work which has much character, and that
which has little or none. And he will find, after some
knowledge of penmanship gained in practice with a broad
nib, that the copying of this fine Italian writing—while
in reality made much more feasible—may even <em class="italic">appear</em>
more difficult than before.</p>

<p>CONSTRUCTION.—The pen has a moderate slant—see thin stroke in
<em class="bold">e</em>. The letters are very square, the tops flat (especially in
<em class="bold">m</em>, <em class="bold">n</em>, and <em class="bold">r</em>), and the lower parts flat (as in
<em class="bold">u</em>). This shows the same tendency that there is in the tenth
century and other hands <em class="italic">to avoid thin or high arches in the letters</em>.</p>

<p>The feet in some of the letters (in <em class="bold">i</em>, for example) are
in the nature of stroke-serifs, but the pen probably made
these with an almost continuous movement—from the stem.</p>

<p><em class="italic">Note</em>—</p>

<ul>
<li>the fine form of the <em class="bold">a</em>;</li>

<li>that <em class="bold">b</em> and <em class="bold">l</em> have an angle where the stem joins the
lower part;</li>

<li>that <em class="bold">f</em> was made something like <em class="bold">t</em>, and the upper
part was added: this was a common mode—see fig.
<a href="#fig180">180</a> (the
<em class="bold">f</em> shown in plate is unfortunately not a good specimen);</li>

<li>that <em class="bold">g</em>—a very graceful letter—lacks the coupling serif;</li>

<li>that <em class="bold">i</em>, <em class="bold">p</em>, <em class="bold">u</em> have <em class="italic">triangular heads</em>, and
<em class="bold">m</em>, <em class="bold">n</em>, <em class="bold">r</em> <em class="italic">hooks</em>;</li>

<li>that the <em class="italic">ascenders</em> have triangular heads, and the <em class="italic">descenders</em>
<em class="bold">p</em> and <em class="bold">q</em>, stroke-serifs;</li>

<li class="clearfix">that the ascending and descending stems are longer than the
bodies, and the writing is in consequence fairly widely spaced.
<span class="xxpn" id="p483"><a class="noform"
href="#pageindex">[p483]</a></span>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Like most of the finest writings, this bears evidences of
considerable speed (see pp. <a href="#p084">84</a>,
<a href="#p311">311</a>). Besides the great uniformity
of the letters, the <em class="italic">coupling strokes</em> are occasionally carried
over the succeeding stroke, the <em class="italic">arches</em> of <em class="bold">b</em>, <em class="bold">h</em>,
<em class="bold">m</em>, <em class="bold">n</em>, <em class="bold">p</em>, <em class="bold">r</em> (and the <em class="italic">heads</em> of the
ascenders) frequently are separated from the stems, and the <em class="bold">o</em>
and <em class="bold">b</em> occasionally fail to join below. These broken forms are
the <em class="italic">results of speed</em>, and are not to be imitated except as to that
which is both a cause and a result—their <em class="italic">uniformity</em> (p.
<a href="#p254">254</a>).</p>

<p>The RULING is in faint ink: there are <em class="italic">two</em> vertical
marginal lines on the left and <em class="italic">one</em> on the right of
every page.</p>

<p>The DECORATION of the MS. is very simple.
The Initial (here shown) is in green and powder-gold,
on a lake ground, with white pattern: there is a very
fine brownish outline, probably drawn first. The two
upper lines of writing and
<img class="letter4" src="images/i483b.jpg"
width="152" height="90" alt="DOUBLE LINE ORO WITH MACRON" />
are in red.</p>

begin as usual at the left margin, but do not extend to the
(true) margin on the <em class="italic">right</em>, hence the latter (the <em class="italic">side</em>
margin on the recto, and the <em class="italic">inner</em> margin on the verso)
would appear unnaturally wide, but the effect is carried
off by the (true) side margins being already exceptionally
wide (and by the writing on the backs of the leaves
showing through the semi-transparent vellum and so
marking the true margins).
<span class="xxpn" id="p484"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p484]</a></span></p>

<p>This mode is very suitable for a book of poems, in
which the lengths of the lines of writing may vary considerably,
because the <em class="italic">writing-line</em> being longer than the
<em class="italic">ordinary</em> line of writing allows room for extraordinarily
long lines, and any appearance of irregularity is carried off
by the extra wide side margins.</p>

<p>THE WRITING is very beautiful, clear, and rapid—made
with a “slanted pen” (see “Italics,” p. <a href="#p311">311</a>, and
fig.
<a href="#fig178">178</a>). Note the <em class="italic">slightness</em> of the slope of the letters
(especially of the Capitals), and the length of the stems
and the wide spacing.</p>

<p>Note, also, the flatness of the curves in <em class="italic">a c d e g o q</em>
and the horizontal top stroke in <em class="italic">a d g q</em>, oblique in <em class="italic">e c</em>
(giving angular tops). The branching away from the stem
of the first part of the arch in <em class="italic">b h m n p r</em> (seen also reversed
in <em class="italic">a d g q u</em>), and the pointed, almost angular, quality of
the <em class="italic">arch</em>. This, which is apt to become a fault in a
more formal upright hand (see note on Plate XXII.) is
helpful in a more rapid running hand, and gives <em class="italic">clearance</em>
to the junctions of the strokes
(<img class="letter4" src="images/i484c1.jpg"
width="151" height="90" alt="strokes" />)—see
fig.
<a href="#fig182">182</a>.</p>

<p>The <em class="italic">heads</em>, simple or built-up, <em class="italic">hooks</em> tending to become
triangular.</p>

<p>The letters in this MS. are rarely coupled.</p>

<p>The very graceful <em class="italic">g</em> has a large pear-shaped lower loop
touching the upper part.</p>

<p>THE WRITING—after tenth century model (see
<a href="#plate08">Plate VIII.</a>)—has the fault (referred to at p.
<a href="#p421">421</a>) of
showing too much <em class="italic">thin</em> line (running up obliquely), the
upper and lower parts of the letters are not flat enough.
The tail of the <em class="bold">g</em> is inadequate, and the lines of writing
are too near together. The writing is readable, however,
and fairly regular. The CAPITALS are Uncials
(after <a href="#plate05">Plate V.</a>) and occasional “Romans.”</p>

<p>The RUBRIC (“¶ <em class="italic">Then shall be said or sung</em>”) is in
red, fitted in beside the round initial and marking the top
left-hand corner of the page (see <em class="italic">footnote</em>, p.
<a href="#p211">211</a>).</p>

<p>The word “GLORY” (and decoration)—and also
the F and T, showing in recto page—are in raised burnished
gold, which, it will be seen, has cracked considerably
in the G (see p.
<a href="#p164">164</a>).</p>

<p>The STAVES are in red (p.
<a href="#p140">140</a>), the <em class="italic">notes</em> above
GLORY in raised <em class="italic">gold</em>, those in the lower stave, <em class="italic">black</em>.</p>

<p>The BOOK was of a special nature (see pp. <a href="#p344">344</a>–<a href="#p345">5</a>),
being intended for use in a certain church and on certain
special festivals: hence a considerable degree of ornament
and a generally decorative treatment was permitted
(p.
<a href="#p330">330</a>). The Prayer of Consecration, together with a
miniature, occupied a complete <em class="italic">opening</em>, the eight margins
of which were filled with solid, framing borders (p.
<a href="#p213">213</a>)
in red, blue, green, and gold. Coats-of-arms and other
special symbols and devices were introduced on the Title
page and in other places.</p>

<p>THE WRITING, very legible, rather “Gothic-Roman.”
<span class="xxpn" id="p486"><a class="noform" href="#pageindex">[p486]</a></span></p>

<p>THE CAPITALS are illuminated throughout the
text in <em class="italic">gold</em> on blue and red grounds. The backgrounds
are square, with edges pointed or indented, outlined <em class="italic">black</em>,
and lined inside <em class="italic">white</em>. The INITIAL <em class="bold">n</em> is in gold on
blue: the moon and stars are in white and gold and white.</p>

<p>THE LINE-FINISHINGS, mostly in black pen-work,
consist of little groups (sometimes of sprays) of
flowers, &#38;c. Sprays from the border separate the
“Song” from the “Tale.”</p>

<p>THE MUSIC.—<em class="italic">Staves</em>
black; <em class="italic">Clefs</em>, gold;
<em class="italic">Notes</em>, red.</p>

<p>THE BORDERS (in the opening from which the plate is taken)
frame the text on both pages—nearly filling the margins (see
p.
<a href="#p213">213</a>): the side and foot edges of the (verso) page are shown
in the plate. The main pattern is a wild rose, flowers and
all, outlined with a rather broad blue line: the stalks and
leaves (lined white) are apple-green, the flowers are <em
class="italic">painted</em> white with raised gold hearts,
the thorns are red. Through the wild rose is twined <em
class="italic">honeysuckle and woody nightshade</em>: stalks—(<em
class="italic">h</em>) red, (<em class="italic">wn</em>) black;
and flowers—(<em class="italic">h</em>) red with yellow spots,
(<em class="italic">wn</em>) purplish red with gold centres.</p>

<p>The whole effect is very brilliant and charming. The
freedom and naturalness of the “design” remind one of a
country hedgerow (p.
<a href="#p213">213</a>), and show that vital beauty
which is the essence of true illumination.</p>

<p>The STONE—a slab of “Hopton Wood” (p. <a
href="#p395">395</a>), 30 inches by 18 inches by 2 inches, is
intended to go over a lintel. It has a simple moulding. Note how
the INSCRIPTION occupies the space (pp. <a href="#p352">352</a>,
<a href="#p394">394</a>): the LETTERS have approximately
the same <em class="italic">apparent weight</em> (p. <a
href="#p328">328</a>)—the large stems are more than twice
the <em class="italic">height</em> of the small; they are

<p>Note the strongly marked and elegantly curved serifs;
the straight-tailed R; the I drawn out (marking the word
IN); the <em class="italic">beaked</em> A, M, and N; the Capital form of <em class="bold">U</em>.</p>

<p>The letters DEO would be rather wide for ordinary
use (p. <a href="#p270">270</a>), but as <em class="italic">special</em> letters, occupying a wide
space,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>
are permissible.</p>

<p>Even in the collotype, I think this inscription shows
to what a high level modern inscription cutting might be
raised by the use of good models and right and simple
methods.</p>

<div class="fsize5"><em class="italic">Extract from Editor’s Preface.</em></div>

<p>“We would have this series put artistic craftsmanship
before people as furnishing reasonable occupation for those
who would gain a livelihood.... In the blending of
handwork and thought in such arts as we propose to deal
with, happy careers may be found as far removed from
the dreary routine of hack labour as from the terrible
uncertainty of academic art. It is desirable in every way
that men of good education should be brought back into the
productive crafts: there are more than enough of us “in
the City,” and it is probable that more consideration will
be given in this century than in the last to Design and
Workmanship.”</p>

<p>“An excellent book opens ‘The Artistic Crafts Series of Technical
Handbooks.’”—Times.</p>

<p>“It would be hard to find any technical book of this kind which
gives more importance to considerations of good taste than
this.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. It leaves no part of its subject unaccounted for, and is
in its own printing, binding, and illustration, a favourable example
of good craftsmanship. Valuable in itself, it promises well for the
series which it opens.”—Scotsman.</p>

<p>“A special word of praise must be bestowed upon the illustrations.”—
Athenæum.</p>

<p>“The first of a new series of technical handbooks, and an admirable
work it is.”—Pall Mall Gazette.</p>

<p>“In a manner lucid and practical the whole process of bookbinding is
set forth, the matter being enhanced in usefulness by the drawings
for which Mr. Noel Rooke is responsible. Altogether the volume gives
the greatest promise for the success of the series.”—Newcastle
Daily Journal.</p>

<p>“Workers of all degrees will find the book well worth acquisition
alike from its valuable material and as inciting to a high standard
of workmanship.”—The British Printer.</p>

<p>“Bookbinders and librarians will find much to interest them in
this lucid, well-illustrated, and valuable little treatise.”—<em class="italic">The
Studio.</em></p>

<p>“Contains so much information useful to every book-owner that it will
be found a very good investment even by the unprofessional.”—The

<p>“A lucid text-book for students and workers, well illustrated,
being the second volume in the series which made a successful
opening with Mr. D. Cockerell’s ‘Bookbinding.’”—The Times.</p>

<p>“It teaches not only processes and workshop practice, but also
good taste in the making of objects in which in these days
vulgarity is none too seldom seen. Admirably illustrated, well
written, and practically serviceable, the book should prove
welcome alike to craftsmen and to amateurs.”—The Scotsman.</p>

<p>“.&#160;.&#160;. The book will have a fascination for all
craftsmen, and may be read with advantage by every one who wishes
to understand the underlying principles of the art crafts.”—The
Morning Post.</p>

<p>“Not only to apprentices and learners, but also to experienced
craftsmen, the book can be most cordially commended. Its value is
enhanced by a full glossary and an index.”—Glasgow Herald.</p>

<p>“This volume, which belongs to the admirable Artistic Crafts
Series of Technical Handbooks, gives practical instruction in
one of the most beautiful of man’s handicrafts.”—The Newcastle
Chronicle.</p>

<p>“We cannot imagine a better aid and supplement to practical
experience in the workshop than this handbook. All necessary
processes, from the simplest to the most complex, are explained
in a methodical and logical order, with the aid of illustrations,
in which each touch is eloquent and fresh from the master’s
hand.”—The Athenæum.</p></div>

<p>“The study of some form of handicraft has become an important
matter in the training of an art student, and those who practise
wood-carving will find in this admirably written and illustrated
book a comprehensive treatise on the subject.”—Morning Post.</p>

<p>“In this notable addition to the Handbooks on the Artistic
Crafts, Mr. Jack deals thoroughly not only with the craftsmanship
of wood-carving, but also with the theory of design, and the
subject-matter which the artist should select to carve.”—<em class="italic">Newcastle
Daily Journal.</em></p>

<p>“The illustrations complete in a very appreciable way the value of
one of the soundest text-books within the reach of the student of
wood-carving.”—Glasgow Herald.</p>

<p>“Quite up to the level of its predecessors.”—Studio.</p>

<p>“His illustrations from both ancient examples and from his own work
are excellently chosen and reproduced, and show that he has made
himself the master and the pupil of the best traditions of his
craft.”—Pall Mall Gazette.</p>

<p>“Clear instruction, profusely illustrated, and admirably presented
by the publisher.”—Sheffield Daily Telegraph.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jack’s love of his art is evidenced by every one of his
chapters&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. To read his book is a pleasure, and we can very
heartily commend it. It is fully illustrated, and contains a number
of fine collotype plates and a good index. It is exceedingly cheap
at the published price of 5s.”—Furniture Record.</p>

<p>“In its affirmative aspect the book is entirely admirable,&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.
and its value is immensely enhanced by the numerous and excellent
illustrations. Its literary quality is greatly superior to that of
the average text-book.”—Builder.</p>

<p>There are a great many cross references to Figures

<p>The symbol "<img class="letter5" src="images/i298b.jpg"
width="90" height="90" alt="N" />", if it appears in a caption
to a Collotype Plate, links back to the Note describing that
Plate. The symbol "<img class="letter5" src="images/i087c1.jpg"
width="71" height="90" alt="lg" />", if it appears in a caption
to a figure, links to a larger version of the illustration.
The extra-large images are available only in the html version.
Most of the images have been refurbished, which means radically
brightened, whitened, and sharpened. The
<a href="#collotype-plates">Collotype Plates</a>,
however, have been subjected to only minor brightening and
sharpening in the midrange, since radical changes necessarily
destroy detail.</p>

<p>Most of the footnotes are renumbered into a single sequence and moved
from the ends of pages to the ends of major sections, which are:
the Author’s Preface, Part I, Part II,
Appendix A, and Appendix B. Footnotes in the section "Notes on the
Collotype Plates" are relocated to the end of
the relevant Plate description.</p>

<p>Ditto marks are generally deleted, and replaced with repeated text
if necessary. Large curly brackets, "{" or "}", used to indicate
combination or grouping of information on two or more lines, have
been eliminated from this ebook. Such information has been recast if
necessary, preferring minimal changes, to retain the original meaning.
The complex tables on page <a href="#p072">72</a> and pages
<a href="#p162">162–3</a> are examples of such
recasting.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#pviii">viii</a>: "ornamention" was changed to

the section "THE COLLOTYPE PLATES". Herein, this structure was
retained, but the broken paragraph was closed, with all of it on
page 430. A new html h2-level heading was inserted at the top
of page 481.</p>

<p>Index, Entry "Black outlines": "88" changed to "188".</p>

<p>Index, Entry "Proportions and Methods": this entry was repeated, once
between "Letters in Bands" and "Letters, Brush-made", and once in its
